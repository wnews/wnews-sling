      "Hey Kids! Did you know that a group of\nfrogs is called an ‘army’? (A group of\ntoads is called a ‘knot’.) In this edition\nof the Waranga News we are taking a\nlook at Australian frogs.",
      "There are over 2500 species of frogs\nthroughout the world. Approximately\n200 species are found only in Australia.\nFrogs are known as an Indicator\nSpecies; that is they tell us something.\nFor example, having many frogs in an\narea tells us the environment is healthy.\nHowever if frogs are suddenly missing\nfrom an area or their numbers decline,\nthis tells us that their environment is\nchanging. This could mean a change in\nthe quality of the air we breathe or the\nwater we drink.",
      "Frogs are amphibians, which means\nthey have a double life. At a young\nstage (tadpoles) they live in water and\nbreathe through gills. As adults they\nbreathe with lungs and live on land.\nHowever they need to be around water\nto breed and keep their skin wet.",
      "<strong>Life cycle of a frog</strong>",
      "Australian native frogs typically\nproduce 1,000 to 2,000 eggs a year.\nWhereas the fearful imported Cane\nToad (Bufo marinus), can lay as many as\n30,000 eggs in one sitting. In spring and\nsummer you will hear male frogs calling.\nThis is the best time to mate and for\nfemales to lay their eggs in any water\nthey can find; pools, puddles, swamps.\nThey will even breed in water troughs\nand buckets filled with rainwater.",
      "Native eggs or spawn appear as white\nfoam floating at the surface of the\nwater; it’s a mixture of air bubbles\nand clear jelly, rather like beaten egg\nwhites. The female uses her hands as\nan egg-beater to whip up the froth as\nshe lays her tiny black and white eggs.\nThe foam protects the eggs from sun\nand predators as they are hidden within\nand beneath the jelly-coated bubbles.\nThe jelly has an awful taste, which\nprotects the eggs from predators until\nthey are ready to hatch.",
      "<strong>Feeding and diet</strong>",
      "Frogs are nocturnal and they are often\nfound around lit areas that attract\nvarious types of bugs and insects to\nthem. Insects and spiders make up\nthe majority of their diet, as well as\ncrickets, lizards, other frogs and\ncockroaches and, when in captivity,\nthey will even eat small mice.",
      "<strong>Frog call</strong>",
      "Frogs are more often heard than seen.\nOnly males call but both sexes may give\nshorter warning calls or screams when\ndanger threatens. The males increase\nthe loudness of their calls by ballooning\nout their throats. Very few Australian\nfrogs make a croaking call; most cackle,\ngrunt, whistle, moan and chime – but\nthe Green Tree Frog is one of the few\nfrogs that do croak; it’s call is a deep\n‘waulk, waulk’.",
      "You may be familiar with the call of\nthe Pobblebonk Frog (also known as\nthe Eastern Banjo Frog). Males usually\ncall concealed in floating vegetation or\nless commonly from land at the water’s\nedge. The call is a short musical,\nexplosive note producing a resonant\n‘bonk’. The call is usually repeated\nevery few seconds. Some individuals\nfrom eastern populations can produce\na rapid series of ‘bonk bonk bonk bonk’\nlasting about one second.",
      "Although frogs are protected across\nAustralia, there are provisions that\nallow you to capture tadpoles, watch\nthem change into frogs, and then\nreturn the juvenile frogs to the place\nyou captured them. It’s a golden\nopportunity to watch a small miracle\nof nature in action. Just remember to\ngive the tadpoles plenty of clean, fresh\nwater (rainwater is best) and some food\n(a bit of boiled spinach or lettuce) and\nthe amazing change from tadpole to\nfrog will take place before your eyes.\nRemember when they become frogs to\nreturn them to where you found the\ntadpoles.",
      "<strong>Would you like to see more frogs\nin your garden?</strong>",
      "Remember that most native frogs\nprefer cool dark places, so find an area\nin your garden that is shady.\nWhen setting up your frog habitat it’s\na great idea to add at least one or two\nsolar lights as these will attract bugs\nat night when the frogs are looking\nfor food. Plant some frog attracting\nfoliage such as Bird Nest plants, Tree\nFerns, Staghorns, and Elkhorns.",
      "Make sure that the frogs have access\nto water. There are many ways to install\nwater into your frog habitat. You can\nutilise many containers; try to recycle\nunused things such as old baths, sinks,\nlaundry tubs and unused bird baths.\nRemember, if you use a bird bath put a\nwater plant in it as this will deter the\nbirds and give the tadpoles and frogs\nsomewhere to hide."
