      "The Flanders poppy has long\nbeen a part of Remembrance Day,\nthe ritual that marks the Armistice\nof 11 November 1918, and is also\nincreasingly being used as part of\nANZAC Day observances. The French\nword ‘Armistice’ means an agreement\nto end fighting, and comes from the\nLatin ‘arma’ meaning ‘arms’ and ‘stitium’\nmeaning “stoppage”.",
      "During the First World War, red\npoppies were among the first plants to\nspring up in the devastated battlefields\nof northern France and Belgium. In\nsoldiers’ folklore, the vivid red of the\npoppy came from the blood of their\nfallen comrades soaking the ground.",
      "This same poppy also flowers in\nTurkey in early spring - as it did in\nApril 1915 when the ANZACs landed\nat Gallipoli. According to Australia’s\nofficial war historian C.E.W.Bean, a\nvalley south of ANZAC beach got its\nname Poppy Valley “from the field of\nbrilliant red poppies near its mouth”.",
      "The sight of poppies on the\nbattlefield at Ypres in 1915 moved\nLieutenant Colonel John McCrae to\nwrite the poem ‘In Flanders fields’.",
      "Colonel McCrae had served as a\ngunner in the Boer War, but went\nto France in World War One as a\nmedical Officer with the first Canadian\nContingent.",
      "At the second battle of Ypres in\n1915, when in charge of a small firstaid\npost, he wrote in pencil on a page\ntorn from his notebook:",
      "<blockquote>In Flanders’ fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row\nThat mark our place, and in the sky\nThe larks still bravely singing, fly\nScarce heard amid the guns below.</blockquote>",
      "<blockquote>We are the dead, short days ago\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow.\nLoved, and were loved, and now we lie\nIn Flanders’ fields.</blockquote>",
      "<blockquote>Take up our quarrel with the foe,\nTo you from failing hands we throw\nThe Torch: be yours to hold it high!\nIf ye break faith with us who die\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\nIn Flanders’ fields.</blockquote>",
      "The verses were apparently sent\nanonymously to the English magazine,\nPunch, which published them under\nthe title, ‘In Flanders’ Fields’. Colonel\nMcCrae died while on active duty in\nMay 1918. His volume of poetry,’ In\nFlanders’ Fields and Other Poems’, was\npublished in 1919.",
      "A young American teacher who\nworked for the YMCA, Moina Michael,\nwrote a poem after reading ‘In Flanders’\nFields’ in 1918. Miss Michael’s poem is\ncalled ‘We Shall Keep the Faith’. She is\ncredited with being the first to wear a\npoppy as a symbol of remembrance.",
      "At a meeting of YMCA secretaries\nfrom other countries, held in November\n1918, she talked about the poem and\nher poppies. Anna Guérin, the French\nYMCA secretary, took the idea further\nby selling poppies to raise money for\nwidows, orphans, and needy veterans\nand their families.",
      "The poppy soon became widely\naccepted throughout the allied\nnations as the flower of remembrance\nto be worn on Armistice Day (now\nRemembrance Day). The Australian\nReturned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial\nLeague (the forerunner to the RSL)\nfirst sold poppies for Armistice Day\nin 1921. For this drive, the League\nimported one million silk poppies, made\nin French orphanages. Each poppy\nwas sold for a shilling: five pence\nwas donated to a charity for French\nchildren, six pence went to the League’s\nown welfare work, and one penny went\nto the League’s national coffers. Today\nthe RSL continues to sell poppies for\nRemembrance Day to raise funds for\nits welfare work.",
      "Here are a few pictures of poppies.\nPerhaps you would like to draw a few\nstems and place them in a spot where\nothers can see them on ANZAC Day.\nPerhaps on a window sill, on your front\ngate, or at your town’s memorial?",
      "Lest we forget."
