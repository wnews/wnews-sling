      "Hey Kids!\nIn this edition we are taking a\nlook into the delicious world of\nchocolate!",
      "Chocolate comes from a fruit tree; it’s\nmade from a seed.",
      "Each tree yields 20-30 pods per year.\nIt takes the whole year’s crop from\none tree to make 450gms of Chocolate.\nBecause cacao trees are so delicate,\nfarmers lose, on average, 30% of their\ncrop each year. Cocao is raised by\nhand, on small, family-owned farms.\nIn addition to tending cacao trees,\nfamily members may harvest bananas\nor other fruit crops. Because the\ncacao pods grow so close to the trunks\nof the plant, they have to be carefully\nremoved by hand by the farm workers.\nSome cacao trees are more than 200\nyears old, but most give marketable\ncocao beans for only the first 25 years.\nThrough some programs supported\nby industry and partners including\nfoundations and governments, farmers\nare now earning between 20 percent\nand 55 percent more from their cacao\ncrops.",
      "Most cocao farms are not owned by\nthe companies that make chocolate.\nWorldwide, 40 million to 50 million\npeople depend upon cocao for their\nlivelihood.",
      "Theobroma cacao is the tree that\nproduces cocao beans, and it means\n“food of the gods.” Carolus Linnaeus,\nthe father of plant taxonomy, named\nit.",
      "About 70% of the world’s supply comes\nfrom Africa, with the Ivory Coast\nbeing the largest single producer and\nproducing 30% of the overall supply.",
      "<strong>How is chocolate made?</strong>",
      "Making chocolate is a process that\nhas many steps. First, the cocao beans\nare collected and put into containers\nto make them ferment. Fermentation\nmakes the sugar in the beans turn into\nalcohol. Then the beans are dried and\ncleaned. Chocolate makers must cook\nthe beans, and then crush them to make\nthe cocao butter and the chocolate\nliquor come out of them.",
      "Then the chocolate maker mixes\ndifferent ingredients together to\nmake the different kinds of chocolate.\nDark or bittersweet chocolate is made\nfrom sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate\nliquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those\ningredients plus milk and vanilla. White\nchocolate does not contain chocolate\nliquor, but only cocoa butter, along with\nsugar, milk and vanilla.",
      "After these ingredients are put\ntogether, the chocolate maker is still\nnot finished. One of the last things to\nbe done is something called conching.\nConching means crushing the chocolate\nvery finely and keeping it warm so that\nit is liquid. Before chocolate is conched,\nit feels very rough in the mouth instead\nof smooth. Conches use heavy rollers\nthat plow back and forth through\nthe chocolate paste under regulated\nspeeds and temperatures. Conching for\nseveral hours to several days makes\ngood chocolate. The last step in making\nchocolate is called tempering. The\nchocolate is heated, and then shaken,\nand then cooled a few times.",
      "<strong>Have you ever wondered why chocolate\nmelts so easily on your tongue?</strong>",
      "The melting point of chocolate ranges\nfrom 26’C through to 32’C. It is the\nonly edible substance that has a\nmelting point below the human body\ntemperature.",
      "<strong>The cacao bean is native to mexico\nand both central and South America.</strong>",
      "It’s believed that inhabitants of these\nareas first started cultivating the bean\nas far back as 1250 BCE, and perhaps\neven earlier.",
      "<strong>Hot chocolate was the first chocolate\ntreat.</strong>",
      "Cacao was brewed in both Mexican and\nAztec culture, though the result was\nnothing like today’s hot chocolate—it\nwas a typically bitter drink that was\noften used for ceremonial occasions\nlike weddings.",
      "<strong>Cacao was once used as currency.</strong>",
      "The Aztecs loved and valued the cacao\nbean so highly that they used it as\ncurrency during the height of their\ncivilization.",
      "<strong>Spanish friars helped spread the\nlove.</strong>",
      "After cacao and chocolate were\nintroduced to Europe, travelling\nSpanish friars took it to various\nmonasteries, handily spreading it\naround the continent.",
      "<strong>A pair of british confectioners\ninvented solid chocolate.</strong>",
      "The Fry and Sons shop concocted what\nthey called “eating chocolate” in 1847\nby combining cocao butter, sugar, and\nchocolate liquor. This was a grainy,\nsolid form of the treat.",
      "<strong>Milk chocolate was invented in\nSwitzerland.</strong>",
      "Daniel Peter created the tasty treat\nin 1875—after eight years of trying to\nmake his recipe work. Condensed milk\nended up being the key ingredient.",
      "<strong>The first chocolate bar was made in\nEngland.</strong>",
      "Way back in 1842, the Cadbury Company\nmade the very first chocolate bar. A\n2020 International survey found that\nCadbury Dairy Milk is the most popular\nchocolate bar in the world, closely\nfollowed by the Mars Bar.",
      "During the war years (1939-1945)\nCadbury became the official supplier\nof chocolate to the Australian Armed\nForces. Cadbury ration chocolate in\nbrown-paper wrappers was supplied to\ntroops in the field, made from a special\nformula so that the precious parcel did\nnot melt in the heat of the tropics or\nthe desert.",
      "Cadbury operates two manufacturing\nsites – one in Claremont, Tasmania, and\none in Melbourne.",
      "<strong>Chocolate is a danger to our four\nlegged friends</strong>",
      "Chocolate should be kept out of reach\nof dogs. It can slow their heart and\nmake them very ill and even kill them."
