      "Hey Kids! In this edition of the\nWaranga News we are learning about\ndifferent types of rainbows, how\nrainbows form, what colours can we\nsee in a rainbow, and much more.\nAnd donâ€™t forget to have a go at the\nRainbow themed wordsearch!",
      "A rainbow is a multi-coloured arc that forms in the\nsky.",
      "Rainbows are created by both reflection and refraction\n(bending) of light in water droplets in the atmosphere,\nwhich results in a spectrum of light appearing.",
      "A rainbow is created when light is bent (refracted)\nwhile entering a droplet of water and reflected. A\nrainbow is actually round. On the ground, the bottom part\nis hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying aeroplane, it\ncan be seen as a circle.",
      "A rainbow is not situated at a specified distance,\ninstead it will always be visible to a person at the precise\nangle freshwater droplets reflect the light which is 42\ndegrees in the opposite direction of the sun.",
      "A rainbow is not an object, it cannot be approached or\nphysically touched.",
      "No two people see the same rainbow, in fact even our\nindividual eyes see slightly different rainbows. If someone\nappears to be standing under a rainbow you can see, they will\nsee a different rainbow at the same angle but further away.",
      "Rainbows can be seen not just in rain but also mist, spray,\nfog, and dew, whenever there are water drops in the air and\nlight shining from behind at the right angle.",
      "Sir Isaac Newton identified the 7 colours of the visible\nspectrum that together make up white light. All of which\nare present in a rainbow in the order\nred, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo\nand violet (the acronym or name ROY G\nBIV is a good way to remember these\ncolours and their order).",
      "Most rainbows we see will be a\n\"primary rainbow\" whereby the colour\nred can be seen on the outer edge\nthrough to violet on the inner edge.",
      "The sky within a primary rainbow is\nbrighter than the sky outside of the arc.\nThis is due to the fact that the millions\nof droplets needed to make a rainbow\nare spherical and overlap to create\nwhite light. At the edge however, these\ncoloured discs don't overlap so display\ntheir individual colours producing the\nrainbow arc.",
      "A \"double rainbow\" is where a second,\nmuch fainter arc can be seen outside of\nthe primary arc. This is caused by the\nlight reflecting twice inside the water\ndroplets. As a result of this double reflection the colours\nof the second arc are inverted with violet on the outer edge\nand red on the inner edge.",
      "The dark, unlit sky between the primary arc and\nsecondary arc is called Alexander's band, after Alexander\nof Aphrodisias who first described it in 200 AD.",
      "Very rarely, light can be reflected 3 or 4 times within a\nwater droplet which produces even fainter tertiary (third)\nand quaternary (fourth) rainbows in the direction of the sun.",
      "A \"moonbow\" is a rare lunar rainbow or night time rainbow\nproduced by light from the moon. Our eyes see it as white\neven though all colours are faintly present.",
      "A \"fogbow\"\nis formed by\ncloud and fog\ndroplets, they\nare almost\nwhite with\nvery faint\ncolours visible.\nFogbows are\nquite large and\nmuch broader\nthan a rainbow."
