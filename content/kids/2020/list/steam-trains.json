      "Hey Kids!\nIn this edition of the Waranga News we are\ntaking a look at steam trains!\nThe train depicted on the Colbinabbin Silo by\nTim Bowtell is an ‘R’ Class.",
      "The ‘R’ class was an express passenger\nsteam locomotive that ran on Victorian\nRailways (VR) from 1951 to 1974. The ‘R’\nclass locomotives were to become the\nlast and most modern steam passenger\nlocomotives on the VR.",
      "There are three ‘R’ class locomotives\nin operation in Victoria, based at the\nNewport West Workshop. The ‘R704’\nis on display at AHRS Railway Museum\nin North Williamstown.",
      "<ul><li>A train is made up of carriages (also\nknown as wagons or cars) pulled by an\nengine (or locomotive). A steam engine\nalso pulls a tender (a wagon containing\nfuel).</li><li>Steam trains were first built (in\nthe early 1800s) to carry goods and\nmaterials, but they soon were used to\ntransport passengers, too.</li><li>Diesel trains started to replace\nsteam trains in the middle of the 20th\ncentury.</li><li>The fastest trains in the world are\npowered by electricity. The electricity\nis transmitted to the train, either by\noverhead cables or through special\nrails running alongside the track.</li></ul>",
      "<strong>Steam Engine Facts</strong>",
      "<ul><li>The first ever steam train was built by\nRichard Trevithick in 1804. This train\nwas too heavy and broke the track, so\nTrevithick built a new engine, called\nCatch Me Who Can. This was lighter\nand worked well on a circular track.</li><li>In 1825, George Stephenson opened\na railway in the north of England.\nHe designed a steam train called\nLocomotion, and used it to pull wagons\nfull of coal.</li><li>George Stephenson’s son Robert\ndesigned the most famous steam engine\ncalled the Rocket. The Rocket was both\nfast (for 1829) and reliable.</li><li>From the 1830s, railways started\nto spread throughout the\nworld. To begin with, British\nbuilt trains were used in\nforeign countries, but\nthen countries like France\nand Germany started to\nmanufacture their own\nsteam locomotives.</li><li>Many individuals made\nlots of money in the railway\nindustry. George Hudson,\nan English businessman, for\nexample, was known as the\n‘Railway King’.</li><li>The oldest working steam\nlocomotive is in India. The\nFairy Queen was built in\nBritain in 1855 and shipped\nto India. It still runs today.</li><li>Steam locomotives have\nthree types of wheels. The\nlargest wheels are known as\nthe ‘driving wheels’. These are turned\nby pistons and make the locomotive\nmove. Small wheels at the front are\ncalled ‘leading wheels’. These help to\nguide the engine forward. Small wheels\nat the back of the locomotive are\ncalled trailing wheels, and these help\nto support the weight of the firebox\nand driver’s cab.</li><li>The first passenger trains had\nthree classes of carriage. First class\ncarriages had many windows and were\nbeautifully decorated and furnished.\nSecond class carriages were designed\nin much more simple fashion. They had\nfewer windows than the first class\ncarriages. Third class carriages were\nvery rough and ready. They weren’t\ndecorated at all, and, before 1840,\nthey didn’t even have a roof.</li><li>The very richest travellers really\ndid travel in luxury in the 19th\ncentury. Queen Victoria’s coaches had\nwalls padded with silk, and Emperor\nNapoleon III of France had a private\ntrain with a balcony and an extensive\nwine collection.</li><li>Steam trains were also used in city\nrailways, but it soon became apparent\nthat they weren’t ideally suited for\nthis purpose – the locomotive’s smoke\ncovered everything in soot. Electricity\npowered trains started to be\nintroduced in cities as an alternative to\nsteam in the 1880s.</li><li>One of the world’s fastest steam\nlocomotives was called The Flying\nScotsman. It was built in Britain and\nwent non-stop between London and\nEdinburgh. In 1934 it become the first\nlocomotive to travel faster than 100\nmph (160.9 kph).</li><li>In 1938, the Mallard set a new steam\nlocomotive speed record when it hit\n138 mph (222kph) in 1938.</li><li>The largest steam engines were built\nin the 1940s. The Union Pacific Big Boy\nlocomotives, for example, were massive\nand could haul 100 full wagons, reaching\nspeeds of 70 mph (112.6kph).</li><li>Steam trains are still used in some\nparts of the world. China, for example,\nstill uses steam locomotives, but no\nnew Chinese steam trains have been\ndesigned since 1982.</li><li>In Australia, Europe and the US,\ngroups of steam enthusiasts restore\nand run steam locomotives, ensuring\nthat steam trains will never disappear\ncompletely. Some lines run steam\nlocomotives purely for the tourist\nindustry.</li></ul>"
