      "Hey Kids!\nIn this edition of the Waranga News\nwe are taking a look at collective\nnouns for animals. We all know which\nanimals move in packs, schools, and\nherds, but what about a wake, a\nbusyness, or a flamboyance?",
      "Many of these terms were first\nrecorded in the 15th century in\npublications known as Books of\nCourtesy – manuals on the various\naspects of noble living, designed for\nyoung aristocrats.",
      "Terms describing animals and birds\nhave many sources of inspiration.\nSome are named for the characteristic\nbehaviour of the animals (‘a leap of\nleopards’, ‘a busyness of ferrets’), or by\nthe use they were put to by humans (‘a\nburden of mules’). Sometimes they’re\ngiven group nouns that describe their\nyoung (‘a kindle of kittens’), and others\nby the way they respond when hunted\n(‘a rout of wolves’). Here are a few\ncollective nouns.",
      "<strong>A Murder of Crows</strong>",
      "In the 15th century, crows were\nconsidered to be omens of death and\nmessengers from the devil or evil\npowers.",
      "<strong>A Wake of Vultures</strong>",
      "For vultures, a wake specifically refers\nto a group feeding on a carcass. The less\nmorbid terms kettle and committee are\nreserved for groups that are flying and\nresting in trees, respectively.",
      "<strong>A Walk of Snails</strong>",
      "Considering walk is one of the things\na snail cannot do, this seems like an\nunusual choice.",
      "<strong>A Parliament of Owls</strong>",
      "It’s unclear when this phrase was\ninvented, with examples dating to\nthe late 19th century. But its origin\nis likely an allusion to Chaucer’s poem\n“The Parliament of Fowls,” alongside\nthe use of parliament as a collective\nnoun for rooks.",
      "<strong>An Ambush of Tigers</strong>",
      "Since tigers tend to be solitary\ncreatures, a grouping of them would\ncertainly feel like an ambush.",
      "<strong>A Skulk of Foxes</strong>",
      "This term likely came about because\nmother foxes raise their young while\nburrowed underground.",
      "<strong>A Hover of Trout</strong>",
      "Since trout tend to swim in groups near\nthe bottom of a lake or river, they\nlikely look like they’re hovering over\nthe bed of the waterway. Alternately,\nit may come from an old term for an\noverhanging rock where fish—like\ntrout—can hide.",
      "<strong>A Bale of Turtles</strong>",
      "Supposedly, a group of turtles who are\ncosy in their shells would look like a\npaddock of round or squarish hay bales.",
      "<strong>A Charm of Hummingbirds</strong>",
      "If just one hummingbird is charming,\ncan you imagine how charming a whole\ngroup of them would be?",
      "<strong>A Prickle of Porcupines</strong>",
      "No explanation needed!",
      "<strong>An Unkindness of Ravens</strong>",
      "Ravens aren’t exactly friendly birds.\nThey will often gang up on their prey\nor animals that enter their space. And\nbecause of the impression that they\nare a dark presence, an unkindness of\nravens can also be called a conspiracy.",
      "<strong>A Mob of Kangaroos</strong>",
      "And just like in human mobs, there’s\nusually a leader (a “boomer,” or adult\nmale) who is only in power for a short\nwhile before being challenged and\ndefeated by a rival boomer. Other\nterms used for Kangaroos include flock\nand troop.",
      "<strong>A Pod of Pelicans</strong>",
      "They can also be called a squadron.",
      "<strong>A Kaleidescope of Butterflies</strong>",
      "Groups of butterflies can also be called\nflutters.",
      "<strong>A Wisdom of Wombats</strong>",
      "Wombats have large brains and are\nincredibly playful, which is often\nviewed as a sign of intelligence.",
      "<strong>A Rout of Wolves</strong>",
      "While pack is definitely the betterknown\nterm today, a very old term for\nwolves is rout.",
      "<strong>A Sleuth of Bears</strong>",
      "This isn’t a reference to any detective\nwork bears may or may not do—it’s\nderived from the Old English word for\nsloth, meaning slow (and sloth itself is\nsometimes used as a collective noun as\nwell).",
      "<strong>A Siege of Herons</strong>",
      "When herons pick a new lake or river to\nrest at, the fish there would certainly\nfeel under siege.",
      "<strong>A Flamboyance of Flamingos</strong>",
      "Perfect don’t you think?",
      "<strong>A Skein of Geese</strong>",
      "A skein is used specifically when geese\n(or other wild birds) are flying, whilst\ngaggle is the term for grounded or\ndomestic geese.",
      "<strong>A Barrel of Monkeys</strong>",
      "Not just a game—it’s a real term.\nMonkeys can also congregate as a\ncarload, troop, or tribe."
