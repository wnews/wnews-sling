      "<strong>Cyclone Larry</strong> made landfall in far north Queensland in 2006 with wind gusts reaching 240 kms per hour, damaging more than half the homes in Innisfail and leaving a repair bill of $1.5 billion.",
      "<strong>Category four Cyclone Tracy</strong> hit Darwin on Christmas Eve in 1974 and killed 71 people. Wind speeds were measured up to 217 kms an hour, before the airportâ€™s airspeed gauge broke. Tracy caused more than $800 million in damage and destroyed about 80 per cent of homes.",
      "<strong>Cyclone Yasi</strong> (also originating near Fiji) hit north Queensland in February 2011, with wind gusts reaching 285 kms per hour. It left a repair bill of about $800 million after destroying homes, shredding crops and smashing marinas and island resorts. One man died from asphyxiation while sheltering in his home.",
      "The next names on the BOM 2020- 2021 Tropical Cyclone list are:",
      "<strong>Imogen, Joshua, Kimi, Lucas, Marian, Niran, Odette, Paddy, Ruby, Seth, Tiffany, and Vernon.</strong>",
      "You can write to the BOM to suggest a cyclone name, but it is likely to be more than a 50-year wait. Names beginning with certain letters such as J, T and S have even longer to wait!"
