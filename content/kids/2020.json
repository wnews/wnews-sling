          "Hey Kids! In this edition of the\nWaranga News we are learning about\ndifferent types of rainbows, how\nrainbows form, what colours can we\nsee in a rainbow, and much more.\nAnd don’t forget to have a go at the\nRainbow themed wordsearch!",
          "A rainbow is a multi-coloured arc that forms in the\nsky.",
          "Rainbows are created by both reflection and refraction\n(bending) of light in water droplets in the atmosphere,\nwhich results in a spectrum of light appearing.",
          "A rainbow is created when light is bent (refracted)\nwhile entering a droplet of water and reflected. A\nrainbow is actually round. On the ground, the bottom part\nis hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying aeroplane, it\ncan be seen as a circle.",
          "A rainbow is not situated at a specified distance,\ninstead it will always be visible to a person at the precise\nangle freshwater droplets reflect the light which is 42\ndegrees in the opposite direction of the sun.",
          "A rainbow is not an object, it cannot be approached or\nphysically touched.",
          "No two people see the same rainbow, in fact even our\nindividual eyes see slightly different rainbows. If someone\nappears to be standing under a rainbow you can see, they will\nsee a different rainbow at the same angle but further away.",
          "Rainbows can be seen not just in rain but also mist, spray,\nfog, and dew, whenever there are water drops in the air and\nlight shining from behind at the right angle.",
          "Sir Isaac Newton identified the 7 colours of the visible\nspectrum that together make up white light. All of which\nare present in a rainbow in the order\nred, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo\nand violet (the acronym or name ROY G\nBIV is a good way to remember these\ncolours and their order).",
          "Most rainbows we see will be a\n\"primary rainbow\" whereby the colour\nred can be seen on the outer edge\nthrough to violet on the inner edge.",
          "The sky within a primary rainbow is\nbrighter than the sky outside of the arc.\nThis is due to the fact that the millions\nof droplets needed to make a rainbow\nare spherical and overlap to create\nwhite light. At the edge however, these\ncoloured discs don't overlap so display\ntheir individual colours producing the\nrainbow arc.",
          "A \"double rainbow\" is where a second,\nmuch fainter arc can be seen outside of\nthe primary arc. This is caused by the\nlight reflecting twice inside the water\ndroplets. As a result of this double reflection the colours\nof the second arc are inverted with violet on the outer edge\nand red on the inner edge.",
          "The dark, unlit sky between the primary arc and\nsecondary arc is called Alexander's band, after Alexander\nof Aphrodisias who first described it in 200 AD.",
          "Very rarely, light can be reflected 3 or 4 times within a\nwater droplet which produces even fainter tertiary (third)\nand quaternary (fourth) rainbows in the direction of the sun.",
          "A \"moonbow\" is a rare lunar rainbow or night time rainbow\nproduced by light from the moon. Our eyes see it as white\neven though all colours are faintly present.",
          "A \"fogbow\"\nis formed by\ncloud and fog\ndroplets, they\nare almost\nwhite with\nvery faint\ncolours visible.\nFogbows are\nquite large and\nmuch broader\nthan a rainbow."

          "Hey Kids!\nIn this edition we are taking a\nlook into the delicious world of\nchocolate!",
          "Chocolate comes from a fruit tree; it’s\nmade from a seed.",
          "Each tree yields 20-30 pods per year.\nIt takes the whole year’s crop from\none tree to make 450gms of Chocolate.\nBecause cacao trees are so delicate,\nfarmers lose, on average, 30% of their\ncrop each year. Cocao is raised by\nhand, on small, family-owned farms.\nIn addition to tending cacao trees,\nfamily members may harvest bananas\nor other fruit crops. Because the\ncacao pods grow so close to the trunks\nof the plant, they have to be carefully\nremoved by hand by the farm workers.\nSome cacao trees are more than 200\nyears old, but most give marketable\ncocao beans for only the first 25 years.\nThrough some programs supported\nby industry and partners including\nfoundations and governments, farmers\nare now earning between 20 percent\nand 55 percent more from their cacao\ncrops.",
          "Most cocao farms are not owned by\nthe companies that make chocolate.\nWorldwide, 40 million to 50 million\npeople depend upon cocao for their\nlivelihood.",
          "Theobroma cacao is the tree that\nproduces cocao beans, and it means\n“food of the gods.” Carolus Linnaeus,\nthe father of plant taxonomy, named\nit.",
          "About 70% of the world’s supply comes\nfrom Africa, with the Ivory Coast\nbeing the largest single producer and\nproducing 30% of the overall supply.",
          "<strong>How is chocolate made?</strong>",
          "Making chocolate is a process that\nhas many steps. First, the cocao beans\nare collected and put into containers\nto make them ferment. Fermentation\nmakes the sugar in the beans turn into\nalcohol. Then the beans are dried and\ncleaned. Chocolate makers must cook\nthe beans, and then crush them to make\nthe cocao butter and the chocolate\nliquor come out of them.",
          "Then the chocolate maker mixes\ndifferent ingredients together to\nmake the different kinds of chocolate.\nDark or bittersweet chocolate is made\nfrom sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate\nliquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those\ningredients plus milk and vanilla. White\nchocolate does not contain chocolate\nliquor, but only cocoa butter, along with\nsugar, milk and vanilla.",
          "After these ingredients are put\ntogether, the chocolate maker is still\nnot finished. One of the last things to\nbe done is something called conching.\nConching means crushing the chocolate\nvery finely and keeping it warm so that\nit is liquid. Before chocolate is conched,\nit feels very rough in the mouth instead\nof smooth. Conches use heavy rollers\nthat plow back and forth through\nthe chocolate paste under regulated\nspeeds and temperatures. Conching for\nseveral hours to several days makes\ngood chocolate. The last step in making\nchocolate is called tempering. The\nchocolate is heated, and then shaken,\nand then cooled a few times.",
          "<strong>Have you ever wondered why chocolate\nmelts so easily on your tongue?</strong>",
          "The melting point of chocolate ranges\nfrom 26’C through to 32’C. It is the\nonly edible substance that has a\nmelting point below the human body\ntemperature.",
          "<strong>The cacao bean is native to mexico\nand both central and South America.</strong>",
          "It’s believed that inhabitants of these\nareas first started cultivating the bean\nas far back as 1250 BCE, and perhaps\neven earlier.",
          "<strong>Hot chocolate was the first chocolate\ntreat.</strong>",
          "Cacao was brewed in both Mexican and\nAztec culture, though the result was\nnothing like today’s hot chocolate—it\nwas a typically bitter drink that was\noften used for ceremonial occasions\nlike weddings.",
          "<strong>Cacao was once used as currency.</strong>",
          "The Aztecs loved and valued the cacao\nbean so highly that they used it as\ncurrency during the height of their\ncivilization.",
          "<strong>Spanish friars helped spread the\nlove.</strong>",
          "After cacao and chocolate were\nintroduced to Europe, travelling\nSpanish friars took it to various\nmonasteries, handily spreading it\naround the continent.",
          "<strong>A pair of british confectioners\ninvented solid chocolate.</strong>",
          "The Fry and Sons shop concocted what\nthey called “eating chocolate” in 1847\nby combining cocao butter, sugar, and\nchocolate liquor. This was a grainy,\nsolid form of the treat.",
          "<strong>Milk chocolate was invented in\nSwitzerland.</strong>",
          "Daniel Peter created the tasty treat\nin 1875—after eight years of trying to\nmake his recipe work. Condensed milk\nended up being the key ingredient.",
          "<strong>The first chocolate bar was made in\nEngland.</strong>",
          "Way back in 1842, the Cadbury Company\nmade the very first chocolate bar. A\n2020 International survey found that\nCadbury Dairy Milk is the most popular\nchocolate bar in the world, closely\nfollowed by the Mars Bar.",
          "During the war years (1939-1945)\nCadbury became the official supplier\nof chocolate to the Australian Armed\nForces. Cadbury ration chocolate in\nbrown-paper wrappers was supplied to\ntroops in the field, made from a special\nformula so that the precious parcel did\nnot melt in the heat of the tropics or\nthe desert.",
          "Cadbury operates two manufacturing\nsites – one in Claremont, Tasmania, and\none in Melbourne.",
          "<strong>Chocolate is a danger to our four\nlegged friends</strong>",
          "Chocolate should be kept out of reach\nof dogs. It can slow their heart and\nmake them very ill and even kill them."

          "There are over 2500 species of frogs\nthroughout the world. Approximately\n200 species are found only in Australia.\nFrogs are known as an Indicator\nSpecies; that is they tell us something.\nFor example, having many frogs in an\narea tells us the environment is healthy.\nHowever if frogs are suddenly missing\nfrom an area or their numbers decline,\nthis tells us that their environment is\nchanging. This could mean a change in\nthe quality of the air we breathe or the\nwater we drink.",
          "Frogs are amphibians, which means\nthey have a double life. At a young\nstage (tadpoles) they live in water and\nbreathe through gills. As adults they\nbreathe with lungs and live on land.\nHowever they need to be around water\nto breed and keep their skin wet.",
          "<strong>Life cycle of a frog</strong>",
          "Australian native frogs typically\nproduce 1,000 to 2,000 eggs a year.\nWhereas the fearful imported Cane\nToad (Bufo marinus), can lay as many as\n30,000 eggs in one sitting. In spring and\nsummer you will hear male frogs calling.\nThis is the best time to mate and for\nfemales to lay their eggs in any water\nthey can find; pools, puddles, swamps.\nThey will even breed in water troughs\nand buckets filled with rainwater.",
          "Native eggs or spawn appear as white\nfoam floating at the surface of the\nwater; it’s a mixture of air bubbles\nand clear jelly, rather like beaten egg\nwhites. The female uses her hands as\nan egg-beater to whip up the froth as\nshe lays her tiny black and white eggs.\nThe foam protects the eggs from sun\nand predators as they are hidden within\nand beneath the jelly-coated bubbles.\nThe jelly has an awful taste, which\nprotects the eggs from predators until\nthey are ready to hatch.",
          "<strong>Feeding and diet</strong>",
          "Frogs are nocturnal and they are often\nfound around lit areas that attract\nvarious types of bugs and insects to\nthem. Insects and spiders make up\nthe majority of their diet, as well as\ncrickets, lizards, other frogs and\ncockroaches and, when in captivity,\nthey will even eat small mice.",
          "<strong>Frog call</strong>",
          "Frogs are more often heard than seen.\nOnly males call but both sexes may give\nshorter warning calls or screams when\ndanger threatens. The males increase\nthe loudness of their calls by ballooning\nout their throats. Very few Australian\nfrogs make a croaking call; most cackle,\ngrunt, whistle, moan and chime – but\nthe Green Tree Frog is one of the few\nfrogs that do croak; it’s call is a deep\n‘waulk, waulk’.",
          "You may be familiar with the call of\nthe Pobblebonk Frog (also known as\nthe Eastern Banjo Frog). Males usually\ncall concealed in floating vegetation or\nless commonly from land at the water’s\nedge. The call is a short musical,\nexplosive note producing a resonant\n‘bonk’. The call is usually repeated\nevery few seconds. Some individuals\nfrom eastern populations can produce\na rapid series of ‘bonk bonk bonk bonk’\nlasting about one second.",
          "Although frogs are protected across\nAustralia, there are provisions that\nallow you to capture tadpoles, watch\nthem change into frogs, and then\nreturn the juvenile frogs to the place\nyou captured them. It’s a golden\nopportunity to watch a small miracle\nof nature in action. Just remember to\ngive the tadpoles plenty of clean, fresh\nwater (rainwater is best) and some food\n(a bit of boiled spinach or lettuce) and\nthe amazing change from tadpole to\nfrog will take place before your eyes.\nRemember when they become frogs to\nreturn them to where you found the\ntadpoles.",
          "<strong>Would you like to see more frogs\nin your garden?</strong>",
          "Remember that most native frogs\nprefer cool dark places, so find an area\nin your garden that is shady.\nWhen setting up your frog habitat it’s\na great idea to add at least one or two\nsolar lights as these will attract bugs\nat night when the frogs are looking\nfor food. Plant some frog attracting\nfoliage such as Bird Nest plants, Tree\nFerns, Staghorns, and Elkhorns.",
          "Make sure that the frogs have access\nto water. There are many ways to install\nwater into your frog habitat. You can\nutilise many containers; try to recycle\nunused things such as old baths, sinks,\nlaundry tubs and unused bird baths.\nRemember, if you use a bird bath put a\nwater plant in it as this will deter the\nbirds and give the tadpoles and frogs\nsomewhere to hide."

          "The Flanders poppy has long\nbeen a part of Remembrance Day,\nthe ritual that marks the Armistice\nof 11 November 1918, and is also\nincreasingly being used as part of\nANZAC Day observances. The French\nword ‘Armistice’ means an agreement\nto end fighting, and comes from the\nLatin ‘arma’ meaning ‘arms’ and ‘stitium’\nmeaning “stoppage”.",
          "During the First World War, red\npoppies were among the first plants to\nspring up in the devastated battlefields\nof northern France and Belgium. In\nsoldiers’ folklore, the vivid red of the\npoppy came from the blood of their\nfallen comrades soaking the ground.",
          "This same poppy also flowers in\nTurkey in early spring - as it did in\nApril 1915 when the ANZACs landed\nat Gallipoli. According to Australia’s\nofficial war historian C.E.W.Bean, a\nvalley south of ANZAC beach got its\nname Poppy Valley “from the field of\nbrilliant red poppies near its mouth”.",
          "The sight of poppies on the\nbattlefield at Ypres in 1915 moved\nLieutenant Colonel John McCrae to\nwrite the poem ‘In Flanders fields’.",
          "Colonel McCrae had served as a\ngunner in the Boer War, but went\nto France in World War One as a\nmedical Officer with the first Canadian\nContingent.",
          "At the second battle of Ypres in\n1915, when in charge of a small firstaid\npost, he wrote in pencil on a page\ntorn from his notebook:",
          "<blockquote>In Flanders’ fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row\nThat mark our place, and in the sky\nThe larks still bravely singing, fly\nScarce heard amid the guns below.</blockquote>",
          "<blockquote>We are the dead, short days ago\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow.\nLoved, and were loved, and now we lie\nIn Flanders’ fields.</blockquote>",
          "<blockquote>Take up our quarrel with the foe,\nTo you from failing hands we throw\nThe Torch: be yours to hold it high!\nIf ye break faith with us who die\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\nIn Flanders’ fields.</blockquote>",
          "The verses were apparently sent\nanonymously to the English magazine,\nPunch, which published them under\nthe title, ‘In Flanders’ Fields’. Colonel\nMcCrae died while on active duty in\nMay 1918. His volume of poetry,’ In\nFlanders’ Fields and Other Poems’, was\npublished in 1919.",
          "A young American teacher who\nworked for the YMCA, Moina Michael,\nwrote a poem after reading ‘In Flanders’\nFields’ in 1918. Miss Michael’s poem is\ncalled ‘We Shall Keep the Faith’. She is\ncredited with being the first to wear a\npoppy as a symbol of remembrance.",
          "At a meeting of YMCA secretaries\nfrom other countries, held in November\n1918, she talked about the poem and\nher poppies. Anna Guérin, the French\nYMCA secretary, took the idea further\nby selling poppies to raise money for\nwidows, orphans, and needy veterans\nand their families.",
          "The poppy soon became widely\naccepted throughout the allied\nnations as the flower of remembrance\nto be worn on Armistice Day (now\nRemembrance Day). The Australian\nReturned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial\nLeague (the forerunner to the RSL)\nfirst sold poppies for Armistice Day\nin 1921. For this drive, the League\nimported one million silk poppies, made\nin French orphanages. Each poppy\nwas sold for a shilling: five pence\nwas donated to a charity for French\nchildren, six pence went to the League’s\nown welfare work, and one penny went\nto the League’s national coffers. Today\nthe RSL continues to sell poppies for\nRemembrance Day to raise funds for\nits welfare work.",
          "Here are a few pictures of poppies.\nPerhaps you would like to draw a few\nstems and place them in a spot where\nothers can see them on ANZAC Day.\nPerhaps on a window sill, on your front\ngate, or at your town’s memorial?",

          "The ‘R’ class was an express passenger\nsteam locomotive that ran on Victorian\nRailways (VR) from 1951 to 1974. The ‘R’\nclass locomotives were to become the\nlast and most modern steam passenger\nlocomotives on the VR.",
          "There are three ‘R’ class locomotives\nin operation in Victoria, based at the\nNewport West Workshop. The ‘R704’\nis on display at AHRS Railway Museum\nin North Williamstown.",
          "<ul><li>A train is made up of carriages (also\nknown as wagons or cars) pulled by an\nengine (or locomotive). A steam engine\nalso pulls a tender (a wagon containing\nfuel).</li><li>Steam trains were first built (in\nthe early 1800s) to carry goods and\nmaterials, but they soon were used to\ntransport passengers, too.</li><li>Diesel trains started to replace\nsteam trains in the middle of the 20th\ncentury.</li><li>The fastest trains in the world are\npowered by electricity. The electricity\nis transmitted to the train, either by\noverhead cables or through special\nrails running alongside the track.</li></ul>",
          "<strong>Steam Engine Facts</strong>",
          "<ul><li>The first ever steam train was built by\nRichard Trevithick in 1804. This train\nwas too heavy and broke the track, so\nTrevithick built a new engine, called\nCatch Me Who Can. This was lighter\nand worked well on a circular track.</li><li>In 1825, George Stephenson opened\na railway in the north of England.\nHe designed a steam train called\nLocomotion, and used it to pull wagons\nfull of coal.</li><li>George Stephenson’s son Robert\ndesigned the most famous steam engine\ncalled the Rocket. The Rocket was both\nfast (for 1829) and reliable.</li><li>From the 1830s, railways started\nto spread throughout the\nworld. To begin with, British\nbuilt trains were used in\nforeign countries, but\nthen countries like France\nand Germany started to\nmanufacture their own\nsteam locomotives.</li><li>Many individuals made\nlots of money in the railway\nindustry. George Hudson,\nan English businessman, for\nexample, was known as the\n‘Railway King’.</li><li>The oldest working steam\nlocomotive is in India. The\nFairy Queen was built in\nBritain in 1855 and shipped\nto India. It still runs today.</li><li>Steam locomotives have\nthree types of wheels. The\nlargest wheels are known as\nthe ‘driving wheels’. These are turned\nby pistons and make the locomotive\nmove. Small wheels at the front are\ncalled ‘leading wheels’. These help to\nguide the engine forward. Small wheels\nat the back of the locomotive are\ncalled trailing wheels, and these help\nto support the weight of the firebox\nand driver’s cab.</li><li>The first passenger trains had\nthree classes of carriage. First class\ncarriages had many windows and were\nbeautifully decorated and furnished.\nSecond class carriages were designed\nin much more simple fashion. They had\nfewer windows than the first class\ncarriages. Third class carriages were\nvery rough and ready. They weren’t\ndecorated at all, and, before 1840,\nthey didn’t even have a roof.</li><li>The very richest travellers really\ndid travel in luxury in the 19th\ncentury. Queen Victoria’s coaches had\nwalls padded with silk, and Emperor\nNapoleon III of France had a private\ntrain with a balcony and an extensive\nwine collection.</li><li>Steam trains were also used in city\nrailways, but it soon became apparent\nthat they weren’t ideally suited for\nthis purpose – the locomotive’s smoke\ncovered everything in soot. Electricity\npowered trains started to be\nintroduced in cities as an alternative to\nsteam in the 1880s.</li><li>One of the world’s fastest steam\nlocomotives was called The Flying\nScotsman. It was built in Britain and\nwent non-stop between London and\nEdinburgh. In 1934 it become the first\nlocomotive to travel faster than 100\nmph (160.9 kph).</li><li>In 1938, the Mallard set a new steam\nlocomotive speed record when it hit\n138 mph (222kph) in 1938.</li><li>The largest steam engines were built\nin the 1940s. The Union Pacific Big Boy\nlocomotives, for example, were massive\nand could haul 100 full wagons, reaching\nspeeds of 70 mph (112.6kph).</li><li>Steam trains are still used in some\nparts of the world. China, for example,\nstill uses steam locomotives, but no\nnew Chinese steam trains have been\ndesigned since 1982.</li><li>In Australia, Europe and the US,\ngroups of steam enthusiasts restore\nand run steam locomotives, ensuring\nthat steam trains will never disappear\ncompletely. Some lines run steam\nlocomotives purely for the tourist\nindustry.</li></ul>"

          "There are four species of Kookaburra",
          "Despite its name, the Shovel-Billed Kookaburra (Latin name Clytoceyx rex) is in the same family as the kookaburras but despite its name is not in the same genus.",
          "Kookaburras all have long bills, which can grow up to 10 cm long.",
          "Although Kookaburras are in the ‘Tree Kingfisher’ family, they don’t need to live near water and fish aren’t a major part of their diet.",
          "Kookaburras are the largest of all the kingfishers.",
          "Although well known for being an Australian bird, Kookaburras are also found in New Guinea.",
          "Kookaburras are famous for their call, which sounds like laughter.",
          "Groups of Kookaburras often call loudly at dawn and dusk. The birds’ calls are known as the ‘Bushman’s Clock’.",
          "All Kookaburras are rated as being of ‘Least Concern’ on the IUCN Red List.",
          "Kookaburras have learned to live alongside humans, and are often seen in suburban areas.",
          "Kookaburras have been known to prey on chicks and ducklings on farms.",
          "The Kookaburra features in the popular children’s song, ‘Kookaburra Sits In The Old Gum Tree’.",
          "There are four species of kookaburra:",
          "<ul><li>Rufous-Bellied Kookaburra (Dacelo gaudichaud)</li><li>Spangled Kookaburra (Dacelo tyro)</li><li>Blue-Winged Kookaburra (Dacelo leachii)</li><li>Laughing Kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae)</li></ul>",
          "<strong>Animal Expert fact</strong>: You can tell an animal’s genus by looking at the first word of its scientific name. For example, the Laughing Kookaburra’s scientific name is ‘Dacelo novaeguineae‘. Therefore its genus is ‘Dacelo‘.",
          "<strong>Meat Eaters!</strong>",
          "Unlike some other members of the kingfisher group, Kookaburras do not have to live by water. They live and feed in native bushland. Fish do not form a major part of their diet. Although Kookaburras are known for being an Australian bird, only the blue-winged and Laughing Kookaburras are found in Australia. The other two species are also found in New Guinea.",
          "<strong>Physical Description</strong>",
          "All four Kookaburras have a similar build. All are reasonably large birds. They have short, rather round bodies, and short tails. The most striking thing about a kookaburra is its big bill.",
          "The Laughing Kookaburra is the best known Kookaburra. It is found in eastern Australia, including Tasmania. It is also found in southwest Australia after having been introduced there in the late 19th century.",
          "The laughing kookaburra has a pale head and chest, with dark wings and tail feathers. It has a long dark patch over its eyes, and of course, a long, powerful-looking bill.",
          "There is a small patch of blue on its wings, but not as much as the bluewinged kookaburra.",
          "<strong>Diet And Hunting</strong>",
          "All kookaburras are mainly carnivorous (meat eaters) and have a varied diet. They eat a range of animals, from insects to snakes.",
          "They will eat insects, small mammals, lizards and even venomous snakes. Kookaburras perch on branches and wait for their prey to approach. When the prey is in range, they swoop down and grab it in their big beaks.",
          "<strong>The Kookaburra’s Laugh</strong>",
          "The Kookaburra’s laugh is a familiar sound in native bushland all over Australia but also around parklands in our many towns and cities. Their unusual call sounds more like a great big belly laugh as if something has really amused them, but they are not really laughing at all; they are actually telling other Kookaburras that this is their territory. Groups of Kookaburras often start laughing at the same time, making an unforgettable din!",
          "<strong>Breeding</strong>",
          "Kookaburras live in families just like us. They mate for life and raise a family together, with the older siblings helping to raise the younger babies. Chicks are born blind and with absolutely no feathers which take a month to grow. (No wonder they need help from their older brothers and sisters.)",
          "<strong>Are Kookaburras Endangered?</strong>",
          "All native wildlife is protected by Australian law. However, any future habitat loss, (such as the New Year bushfire season), would threaten the Kookaburras.",
          "<strong>A fun fact:</strong> In many of the old Tarzan movies, the jungle sounds were often recordings of the laughing Kookaburra call, which lives nowhere near Africa!"

          "The Black Swan Cygnus (swan) atratus (covered in black, as for mourning) is a large waterbird that mostly breeds in the southeast and southwest areas of Australia. It is different from other swans because it is mostly black, though its flight feathers are white.",
          "The bill is bright red, with a pale bar and tip; and legs and feet are greyishblack. Cobs (males) are slightly larger than pens (females), with a longer and straighter bill. Cygnets (immature birds) are a greyish-brown with paleedged feathers.",
          "A mature black swan measures between 110 and 142 centimetres in length and weighs 3.7–9 kilograms. Its wingspan is between 1.6 and 2 metres. The neck is long (relatively the longest neck amongst the swans) and curved in an “S”- shape.",
          "The black swan utters a musical and far reaching bugle-like sound, called either on the water or in flight, as well as a range of softer crooning notes. It can also whistle, especially when disturbed while breeding and nesting.",
          "When swimming, black swans hold their necks arched or erect and often carry their feathers or wings raised in an aggressive display. In flight, a wedge of black swans will form as a line or a V, with the individual birds flying strongly with undulating long necks, making whistling sounds with their wings and baying, bugling or trumpeting calls.",
          "The black swan is unlike any other Australian bird, although in poor light and at long range it may be confused with a magpie goose in flight. However, the black swan can be distinguished by its much longer neck and slower wing beat.",
          "<strong>Habitat</strong>",
          "The black swan is common in the wetlands of south-western and eastern Australia and adjacent coastal islands. In the south west the range encompasses an area between North West Cape, Cape Leeuwin and Eucla; while in the east it covers a large region bounded by the Atherton Tableland, the Eyre Peninsula, and Tasmania, with the Murray Darling Basin supporting very large populations of black swans. It is uncommon in central and northern Australia.",
          "The black swan’s preferred habitat extends across fresh, brackish and salt water lakes, swamps and rivers with underwater and emergent vegetation for food and nesting materials. Permanent wetlands are preferred, including ornamental lakes, but black swans can also be found in flooded paddocks and tidal mudflats, and occasionally on the open sea near islands or the shore.",
          "Black swans were once thought to be sedentary, but the species is now known to be highly nomadic. There is no set migratory pattern, but rather opportunistic responses to either rainfall or drought. In high rainfall years, emigration occurs from the south west and south east into the interior, with a reverse migration to these heartlands in drier years. When rain does fall in the arid central regions, black swans will migrate to these areas to nest and raise their young. However, should dry conditions return before the young have been raised, the adult birds will abandon the nests and their eggs or cygnets and return to wetter areas.",
          "Black swans, like many other waterfowl, lose all their flight feathers at once when they moult after breeding and they are unable to fly for about a month. During this time they will usually settle on large, open waters for safety.",
          "The current Australian black swan population is estimated to be up to 500,000 individuals. No threat of extinction or significant decline in population has been identified with this numerous and widespread bird.",
          "Black swans were first seen by Europeans in 1697, when Willem de Vlamingh’s expedition explored the Swan River, Western Australia.",
          "<strong>Diet and feeding</strong>",
          "The black swan is almost exclusively herbivorous, and while there is some regional and seasonal variation, the diet is generally dominated by aquatic and marshland plants.",
          "The black swan feeds in a similar manner to other swans. When feeding in shallow water it will dip its head and neck under the water and it is able to keep its head flat against the bottom while keeping its body horizontal. In deeper water the bird up-ends to reach lower. Black swans are also able to filter feed at the water’s surface.",
          "<strong>Nesting and reproduction</strong>",
          "Like other swans, the black swan is largely monogamous, pairing for life (about 6% divorce rate).",
          "Generally, black swans nest in the wetter and colder months (May to September). A black swan nest is essentially a large heap or mound of reeds, grasses and weeds between 1 and 1.5 metres in diameter and up to 1 metre high, in shallow water or on islands. A nest is reused every year, restored or rebuilt as needed. Both parents share the care of the nest. A typical clutch contains four to eight greenish-white eggs that are incubated for about 35–40 days. Incubation begins after the laying of the last egg, to synchronise the hatching of the chicks. Prior to the commencement of incubation the parent will sit over the eggs without actually warming them. Both sexes incubate the eggs, with the female incubating at night. The change over between incubation periods is marked by ritualised displays by both sexes. If eggs accidentally roll out of the nest both sexes will retrieve the egg using the neck (in other swan species only the female performs this feat). Like all swans, black swans will aggressively defend their nests with their wings and beaks. After hatching, the cygnets are tended by the parents for about nine months until fledging. Cygnets may ride on their parent’s back for longer trips into deeper water, but black swans undertake this behaviour less frequently than mute and blacknecked swans.",
          "The life span for a black swan is up to 40 years."

          "Hey Kids! The platypus is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom. Read all about this amazing Australian and then have a go at the wordsearch!",
          "Platypuses have a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver; a sleek, furry body like an otter; and a flat bill and webbed feet like a duck. In fact, the first time a platypus was brought from Australia to Britain, people couldn‛t believe that it was a real animal. They thought that a trickster had sewn two animals together!",
          "Platypuses are among the few venomous mammals. Males have a spur on the back of their hind feet that is connected to a venom-secreting gland. More venom is secreted during mating season, leading researchers to think that the spurs and venom help males compete for mates. The venom is not life threatening to humans, but it can cause severe swelling and “excruciating pain”.",
          "<strong>Size and appearance</strong>",
          "A typical platypus is 38 cm from its head to the end of its rump. Its tail adds an additional 13 cm to the animal‛s length. An individual weighs about 1.4 kg, though platypuses that live in colder climates are bigger than those living in warmer areas, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Scientists have found fossils that suggest that ancient platypuses were twice as large as the modern variety, at around 1 metre long.",
          "Platypuses have dense, thick fur that helps them stay warm underwater. Most of the fur is dark brown, except for a patch of lighter fur near each eye, and lighter-coloured fur on the underside.",
          "Their front feet have extra skin that acts like a paddle when the animals are swimming. When platypuses are on land, their webbing retracts, making the claws more pronounced. The animals walk awkwardly on their knuckles to protect the webbing.",
          "The bill of a platypus, sometimes called a duck-billed platypus, has a smooth texture that feels like suede. It is also flexible and rubbery. The skin of the bill holds thousands of receptors that help the platypus navigate underwater and detect movement of potential food, such as freshwater shrimp.",
          "<strong>Habitat</strong>",
          "Platypuses make their homes in the freshwater areas that flow throughout Tasmania and the eastern and south-eastern coast of Australia. While they are in the water a lot, they will also waddle onto the riverbanks to dig burrows with their claws. These burrows are tunnels that have rooms or chambers. Platypuses also live under rock ledges, roots or debris.",
          "Though they exist on only one side of the Australian continent, platypuses weather many climate extremes. They have been found in plateaus, lowlands, tropical rainforests, and the cold mountains of Tasmania and the Australian Alps. Their waterproof, thick fur keeps platypuses warm in chilly temperatures, and their big tails store extra fat for energy.",
          "Platypuses usually spend their time hunting for food, and a hunt can last 10 to 12 hours. They are most active during night time and dusk, because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day. When not hunting, they stay in their burrows.",
          "<strong>Diet</strong>",
          "Platypuses are carnivorous, which means they eat meat but not plants. They hunt for their food in the water where they live. As they swim, they try to detect food along the muddy bottom of the river, stream, pond or lake using their sensitive bills. When platypuses find something interesting, like shellfish, insects, larvae or worms, they scoop it up in their bills, store it in their cheek pouches and swim to the surface. The platypus grinds up its prey using rough pads located at the back of its jaws.",
          "<strong>Baby platypuses</strong>",
          "Most mammals give birth to live young. Platypuses, however, lay eggs. They are a species of primitive mammals called monotremes. Echidnas are the only other mammals that lay eggs.",
          "When the female platypus is ready to have her young, she will burrow down inside the ground on the riverbank and seal herself into one of her tunnel rooms. Then, she will lay one or two eggs and place them between her rump and her tail to keep them warm. After about 10 days, the eggs hatch and the little, bean-sized babies will be nursed for three to four months. Around the time of weaning, baby platypuses can swim on their own.",
          "<strong>Movement</strong>",
          "Platypuses swim with their front feet and steer with their tails and back feet. They have waterproof fur, skin that covers their ears and eyes, and noses that seal shut to protect the animals while they are underwater. Though platypuses are made for the water, they can‛t stay completely submerged. They can only stay underwater for 30 to 140 seconds.",
          "These short creatures are much better at moving through water than across land. They use 30 percent more energy walking across land than swimming through the water, according to the Australian Museum of History."

          "Contrary to popular belief, not all bats live in caves. Bats can be found in trees, mountains, deserts, rock crevices, farm sheds, and rooftops.",
          "A few species of bats, such as the white-winged and hairy-legged vampire bats, purely feed on animal blood. There are only three species of vampire bat and they only occur in Central and South America. Vampire bats consume blood from large mammals such as cattle; they make a small bite on their prey‛s limbs and lap up the blood as it drips from the cut. Vampire bats have occasionally bitten people (usually someone asleep in a hammock), but when this happens, the vampire bat usually bites the person‛s toe – not their necks as depicted in movies!",
          "Bats have diverse diets that include more than just blood. They eat nectar, pollen, fruit, birds, insects, frogs, lizards, and much more.",
          "<strong>Did You Know….</strong>",
          "<ul><li>Bats are a very important pollinator of native plants and disperse seeds over a wide area.</li><li>There are about 1100 species of bats in the world. Australia has 90 different species of bats.</li><li>The smallest bat in the world is the Bumble Bee Bat which lives in Thailand and weighs only 2 grams.</li><li>The largest bat in the world is the Giant Flying Fox which lives in India and has a wingspan of 1.8 metres.</li><li>Bats cannot stand on their hind legs, they can only hang by their feet and by their thumbs.</li><li>The order name of the bat is called Chiroptera, which means ‘hand wing‛. It‛s called that because their wing structure is almost the same as our hands.</li><li>Some species are threatened with extinction.</li></ul>",
          "In south-eastern Australia, the most critically endangered species is the Southern Bent-wing Bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii), a species that occurs only in caves in south-western Victoria and south- eastern South Australia.",
          "<strong>Microbat or Megabat?</strong>",
          "Insect eating bats, belong to a group of bats called ‘microbats‛ which find their way through the dark by using ‘echolocation‛, listening to the echoes from their high pitched calls. These calls are usually well above the range of human hearing so we can‛t hear them, but some species like the Whitestriped Freetail Bat can be heard by humans.",
          "They feed on a range of insects, including many pest species. They can also slow their bodies down and go into torpor (a mild form of hibernation) to save energy when it is cold or when they‛re inactive during the day. They can live a very long time for such small animals, sometimes more than 30 years, but usually 15 to 20 years.",
          "Microbats eat a LOT! Flying takes considerable energy. As a result they eat lots, up to three-quarters of their own body weight in insects in a night!",
          "Bats are natural aerial acrobats! While most bats catch insects in their mouths, they can also catch insects in their wing membrane, flick them into the tail membrane, and then grab them with their mouth, all while in flight.",
          "Megabats, or flying foxes as they are usually called, are a much larger in size with a wingspan of up to one metre. They feed on fruit, blossoms and nectar. They do not use echolocation to navigate at night but have welldeveloped eyes and a strong sense of smell, which helps them locate food. They live in social groups in trees called a “camp” or a “colony”.",
          "Some larger fruit and nectar eating bats are called ‘flying foxes‛, because their faces look a little like a fox, although they are totally unrelated. Some flying foxes can fly very long distances.",
          "Flying foxes play an important role in pollination and seed dispersal of fruiting and flowering trees."

          "In this edition of the Waranga News we are taking a look at the wonderful wombats that inhabit our continent. There are three species of wombat: Common wombat, Northern hairy-nose wombat and Southern hairy-nose wombat.",
          "Wombats are Australian marsupial mammals that have very short muscular legs and are the closest relative to the Koala. They have a backwards facing pouch so that when they are nursing young in their pouch they can still dig burrows and not fill their pouch with soil! Wombats feed on grasses and roots (they are herbivores) and dig long extensive burrow systems with their powerful claws.",
          "Wombats are generally slow movers however they can run quickly if required. Their best form of defence though is when they are in their burrow. Here if they are cornered they can crush their would be predator/attacker underground using a large solid plate in their backside against the roof of their burrow.",
          "During the recent East Coast bushfires, many different species of small mammals and insects found refuge underground in wombat burrows.",
          "<strong>Breeding</strong>",
          "Wombats can reproduce after they reach 2 years of age and they normally breed between September and December. Wombats are marsupial mammals and the newborn wombat, which weighs about 1 gram and is less than 3 centimetres long, has to crawl from the birth canal into the mother’s pouch. Young wombats will normally stay in the pouch for 7-10 months.",
          "The main habitat for the Common Wombat is the temperate forest-covered areas of south-eastern Australia. The species tends to avoid rainforests and is often found in the m o u n t a i n o u s areas.",
          "W o m b a t s prefer to dig their main shelters on slopes above creeks and gullies, and feed in grassy clearings.",
          "A wombat usually leaves the burrow after sunset and begins to graze for several hours. During this time, it may return to its burrow to rest, or seek refuge, and it will return to sleep generally before sunrise. However, in cool or overcast days the animals are known to forage longer and during the day.",
          "The main food for wombats is fibrous native grasses, sedges and rushes, and the choice of food depends on what is available at the time. Wombats seem to prefer Tussock Grass in the forest areas, and Kangaroo Grass and Wallaby Grass are favoured in open, more pastoral areas. At times when it is eating grass, a wombat will also eat dry leaves and stalks, and occasionally tear a strip of bark from a tree trunk and chew small quantities of it. In some habitats, wombats also feed on mosses, possibly as a source of water, given their low nutritional value.",
          "A wombat is a short, stocky, barrel-shaped animal with physical characteristics that reflect its burrowing nature. It has a broad head with small eyes, a short strong neck, powerful shoulders and a very small tail hidden by fur. Colouring of the wombat’s coarse coat varies from glossy black, dark grey, silver-grey, chocolate brown, grey-brown, sandy and cream. In southern Victoria, there is a small colony of ash-white wombats and albino animals have been reported too. Often the coat can also be coloured by the soil (e.g. clay can stain the fur red), and/or have patches that are lighter in colour.",
          "Wombats differ from other marsupials by having only two incisor teeth in the upper jaw. The incisor and molar teeth of this animal are also unique because they have open roots and continue to grow throughout the animal’s life."

          "Centuries ago in England, the traditional Christmas meal was a pig’s head with mustard, boar, or roast peacock! However, it wasn’t until Henry VIII had turkey for Christmas in the 16th century that traditions changed. Turkey is now the traditional Christmas meal in most English speaking countries. Here in Australia you may enjoy your turkey cold with salads - a meal much better suited to the summertime heat. In the year 1213, King John of England ordered 3,000 capons (fattened chickens), 1,000 salted eels, 400 hogs, 24 casks of wine and much, much more for his Christmas dinner, making the Duke of Northumberland’s Christmas menu in 1512 of 5 swans seem rather modest. In 1580 Christmas feasts were back on par with Sir William Petrie ordering 17 oxen, 14 steers, 29 calves, 5 hogs, 13 bucks, 54 lambs, 129 sheep and one tonne of cheese.",
          "Santa has a list and he’s checking it twice. Bad children get coal and the good ones get tangerines. Tangerines? In the U.K, good kids traditionally get a tangerine in their Christmas stocking. This practice began with nuns in 12th century France, who left stockings filled with nuts, tangerines, and other fruits at the houses of poor families. To their credit, a dose of vitamin C is actually a perfect gift during the colder winter months.",
          "Although the classic Christmas cake, Bûche de Noël, or Yule log, is French, the custom comes from pagan British celebrations of midwinter, or Yule, where a log was burned in homes to banish darkness and bad luck. By the Tudor period, the Yule log was decorated with ribbons and kept burning for the 12 days of Christmas. The French log-shaped dessert made of chocolate cake and pastry cream symbolizes the belief that a log should burn continuously on Christmas night.",
          "Eggnog, a f a v o u r i t e h o l i d a y drink in the n o r t h e r n hemisphere, derives from the British aristocracy. The w e a l t h y d r a n k w a r m e d milk and egg beverages l a c e d with expensive spices and brandy or sherry to keep them from spoiling. The origin of the word nog is disputed, but it may come from noggin, a kind of wooden mug; there was also a kind of English ale called nog. Nogs were often made to toast to health, perfect for Christmastide special occasions.",
          "Legend has it that candy canes were invented in 1670, when the choirmaster of the Cologne Cathedral commissioned lollies shaped like a shepherd’s crook so they could be handed out to children attending the church’s crèche scene in order to keep them quiet. The stripes came later.",
          "The earliest mince pies date back to medieval times, if not earlier, and typically included minced meat, suet, fruits, nuts, and spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. The pie was originally crustless, but over time a crust was added, and a pastry effigy of the baby Jesus was traditionally laid on top. Today, meat isn’t an ingredient in mince pies.",
          "On 25 December Japanese flock to the American fast food chain KFC in Tokyo, thanks to the impact of a “Kentucky for Christmas” marketing campaign that hit about 40 years ago. The tradition is now so popular that diners book ahead by a couple of months to secure a seat to enjoy a bucket of fried chicken!",
          "In many countries, children leave a plate of biscuits and milk as light refreshment for Santa Claus during his long night of delivering presents. The tradition began from another custom: when Christmas trees used to be decorated with food. In the past, especially in Germany, apples, sweet biscuits and dried fruits were used to decorate the festive tree: some of these decorations, however, disappeared during the night, or rather, were devoured. This led to speculation that it was Santa looking from some late-night snacks when leaving the children their presents.",
          "<strong>In Chile They Start to Eat at Dawn</strong>",
          "Most of us are familiar with a long Christmas lunch running into the evening, but how about starting at dawn? This is what happens in Chile, South America, when lunch (or dinner?) starts at dawn on 25 December, after the traditional Misa del Gallo, or Mass.",
          "The precursor to the Christmas pudding was a 14th-century porridge called ‘frumenty’ that was made of beef and mutton with raisins, currants, prunes, wine and spices. By the 17th century, the pudding, as we know it today, was widely eaten. It was t r a d i t i o n a l l y made at the start of advent to allow the alcohol and flavours to develop. A tradition of ‘ S t i r - i t - u p - Sunday’ when each member of the household stirred the mixture while facing east to Bethlehem and making a wish was also practised. Most likely as a way of getting more muscle power to mix through the heavy mixture.",
          "Jansson’s Temptation in Sweden: Janssons Frestelse is a traditional part of the Swedish Christmas smörgåsbord, and it’s basically a potato gratin flavoured with pickled anchovies. This dish is supposed to be “creamy with a tiny hint of the ocean.”",
          "Bacalhoada Ao Forno in Brazil: In Mexico, Brazil, and other parts of South America, the European tradition of salt cod dishes at Christmas became traditional in the last few centuries. In Brazil, this takes the shape of oven-roasted bacalao with potatoes, capsicum, and garlic.",
          "Fried Carp and Pea Soup in Eastern Europe: In Poland, the Czech Republic, and elsewhere, a traditional Christmas meal often centres on a soup course — either fish or pea soup, followed by fried carp and potato salad.",
