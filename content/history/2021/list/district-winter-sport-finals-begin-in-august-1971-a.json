      "District winter sport finals begin in August 1971\nThe winter of 1971 continued wetter than average, impacting on a lot of outdoor sport. Waranga Shire Council had a busy agenda, as a new riding was created and an election held to choose three new councillors.\n",
      "Shire",
      "\nWaranga Shire Council decided to run the garbage collection service once external contract arrangements expired. Shire engineer Max Richards estimated 2-3 men on a truck for one day a week would cost $3000 annually.\n200 new chairs ($6.50 each) and 20 new tables ($28.50) were purchased for the Shire Hall. A new table was also purchased for the Council meeting room, as three new councillors had been added with the new South-Eastern Riding. They were Len Coyle, Allan Hammond and John Hammond.\n",
      "Rushworth tip caretaker Bill Campbell’s appointment was extended, on $416 per year plus salvage rights for his “job on the Council”.\n",
      "A poll of ratepayers was to influence whether Council took over the Rushworth Water Trust administration.\nCouncil considered a new Health Commission directive that piggery operators must be 800 metres from channels and other waterways. 95% of local piggeries were to be impacted.\n",

      "Rangers were enrolled at Rushworth. Dianne Barber, Jenny Bell, Carol Cruz, Marilyn Cruz, Christine Damon, Margaret Hammond, Dianne Perry and Rosalie Hawking might still be rangers, out on the range. (I obviously have no idea what a ranger was or did. How long did they last?)\n",
      "Rushworth and District Historical Society had Miss Olive Sprunt as guest speaker, recalling her days teaching earlier in the century, and events at Burrumboot East and Wanalta.\n",
      "Sport\n",
      "Footy Club claybird shoot at Moora had women’s event won by Mrs L. Morgan (Marj), ahead of Mrs G. Whiteacre (Marea), and Mrs K. Kerrins (Helen).

      "Mrs Olive Service retired after 35 years in a (primarily) drapery business and thanked all her clients.\nAt Barbara Bell’s workplace, the Primary School, she was given a shower tea, ahead of her marriage to Graeme Johansen who had a bucks’ night, but I was too young to attend.\n",
      "Beryl Home hit a hole in one at Rushworth. Another lady hit her ball into the same hole in one stroke, but it came off the wrong tee!\n",
      "At Murchison, Gordon McMaster won the Barrett Trophy handicap event, defeating Brian Brady.\n",
      "Kerryn Duke of Colbinabbin had thrown more goals than anyone else in A-grade of Heathcote District Netball Association. A presentation dance was held in the Shire Hall at Rushworth.\n",

      "The hockey team won their way into the Grand Final, Mari Slykerman and Marilyn McKeon each netting two goals. Lorraine Flynn, Beth Shanks and Val Perry were the stars.\nThere was semi-final excitement in table tennis. Going straight into the big one were Colts in A-grade, High School in B-grade, Methodist Blue in C-grade (Cheryl and Trevor Hawking, with cousin Peter Raglus were unbackable favourites), and Saintly Cats in D-Grade, with Ian Cruz and Gerard McArdle leading the charge.\n",

      "Rushworth Thirds (Under-15s) also won easily over Heathcote, 17-9 to 5-3. (The present Under-18 competitions in HDFL and KDFL should be Under-15 or Under-16.)",
      "The following week Colbo Seniors tumbled out of the preliminary final, no match for Mounts who had a habit of coming good at the business end. 16-12 to 8-15 was the score and some of Colbo’s ex-radius players were a little less than prominent. Ron Critchley, Peter Nihill, Barry Evendon, Barney Tuohey, Michael Frawley, John Tuohey and Tony Stribley shone for the Mountain Men.\n",
