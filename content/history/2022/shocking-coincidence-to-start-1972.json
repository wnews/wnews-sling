      "Fifty years ago, 1972 started badly for a local (bottom) publican and twelve of his drinkers. In a remarkable coincidence, their watches must have stopped simultaneously, just before closing time. All were found guilty and fined for selling or drinking liquor outside legal hours! Three are still living, and mates of mine, so best we leave the story there.\n",

      "Council business\n",

      "A public meeting was held in the Shire Hall in protest at re-valuation of properties in Waranga Shire, and the resultant rate increases, including speculation about an appeal to the Supreme Court. (Good luck finding the funds for that!)\n",

      "History\n",

      "Community\n",
      "A massive strike within the State Electricity Commission shut down factories and businesses as power supplies were rationed to households. Evening sport involving lighting was banned.\n",
      "Compulsory chest X-rays to detect TB in adults were promoted across the district. A fine of $40 was the liability for non-attendance.\n",

      "At Murchison, inaugural trustees met to discuss what was called the New Public Hall. There was concern that despite Murchison’s brand new pool, few parents attended the pool committee annual meeting. (Now where have we heard that before?)\n",
      "Rushworth RSL had a Ladies Auxiliary, Mrs Win Hageman as president.\n",
      "A Victorian duck season licence was available for $3 from Howard and Rosemary Hawking’s hardware store.\n",

      "Mrs Johansen presented the preps with a new tortoise, Mr Tickles, and the school now received the daily milk supply in white patterned plastic bags instead of third-pint bottles.\n",
      "House captains elected were Dianne Allen and Chris Clarke (Murray House), Isabel McLean and Adrian Weston (Ovens), Patricia Roberts and Allan McGillivray (Campaspe), Lyn Home and Malcolm Cruz (Goulburn). (These were the “big kids” of grade 6!)\n",
      "Personal\n",
      "Kitchen teas were popular. Yvonne Pettifer was hosted at the home of her aunt Chris Wootton, Mary Beck presenting gifts on behalf of all. Frances Kennedy was featured at the Fire Station when Mrs Eileen Lambden did the presentation honours.\n",
      "The newspaper caught up with a late report of the January wedding of Kathleen Elizabeth Grigg and Edward Leonard John Clarke at St Mary’s Church. (Equally late golden wedding anniversary congratulations to you both.)\n",
      "Passing were Alfred Furphy, at Sale, brother of Bill, Mrs Ivy Buzza and Mrs Arthur Lynas, and Elsie Kinsman of Rushworth, sister to eight siblings. Former resident Jim Abikhair died in Melbourne, as did Mrs Les Wood (nee Colliver), who was raised at Rushworth.\n",

      "Cec Bradley was the new champion at Rushworth bowls, defeating Jack Borger. Losing semi-finalists were Charlie Jones and Jeff Geddes. To fund the painting of the pavilion, all players were levied 50 cents. (There were more players then, but that fund would not buy a decent paint roller today!)\n",
      "Six weeks before the first football match, Rushworth was to start training under new playing coach Bob Wilson, who drove a bread van for Sunicrust Bakeries. Plans of other district clubs were not reported, or training commenced sensibly a little later."
