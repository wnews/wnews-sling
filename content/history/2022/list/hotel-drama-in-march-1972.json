      "Rushworth Hotel licencee Kevin Kerrins was the victim of an assault by a patron who was fined just $40 by the Magistrate, Mr. A. J. Curtain. Supporting Mr Kerrins in warding off the out-of-town attacker were Kevin and Jack Clarke, who happened to be in the pub at the time.\nCriterion Hotel licencee Peter McCann, defending a charge of illegal gambling on premises, told the magistrate that he had been assisted by the TAB operator at Stanhope, who supplied him with betting sheets and settled up every Tuesday. Kevin Kerrins made a similar claim on the same charge. Both said they were told by the Stanhope operator that it was “Okay, because Rushworth will get a TAB agency soon”.
