      "A 20-year-old Rushworth man was fined for stating false name and address to police, riding a motorcycle without a licence, riding an unregistered motorcycle, riding without third party insurance, and carrying a pillion passenger. His licence was cancelled and the fine was $217.\n",

      "Grade 1 “went to the police station and saw the jail, the court house, dogs, hand-cuffs and caps. Mr Foley took our finger-prints. Mr Curley put a stamp on our hands”. \nGrade three girls made some perfume but “we don’t know if it has worked yet”.\n",
      "St Mary’s school played Rushworth Primary in footy and netball. Primary won the footy, with the three netball games shared.

Best triers were Anthony Barlow, Trevor Branson, Trevor Cheatley, Graeme Weeks, John Weppner, Bob McLean and Peter Reed.\n",
      "Rushworth took the challenge up to Mounts. We had cleared Mal Potter to Sandhurst, and were four points behind at quarter time, five points down at half time, five points behind at three-quarter time, and at the end down 15-27 to 16-13. Mounts should have won by more, kicking inaccurately. Barney Tuohey (seven goals) best for Mounts, Bill Barlow for Rushworth, as Laurie Downie kicked eight. ",
