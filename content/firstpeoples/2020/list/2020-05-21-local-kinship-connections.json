      "Mentioned in the previous story, Tattambo\n(often referred to by Europeans as King\nCharles) was apparently born into a clan of\nthe Ngurai-illum Wurrung people called the\nGunung Willam, whose home country was on\nthe Campaspe River south of Elmore.

      "<strong>Family</strong>",
      "We do not know much about Tattambo’s\nsiblings, apart from a brief reference to a sister,\nwho was called “Sarah” by the Europeans.\nIn 1874, a Mr Green, superintendent of the\nCoranderrk Aboriginal Reserve, near presentday\nHealesville, was trying to encourage any\nremaining Aboriginal people living around\nMurchison to transfer to the Reserve. Noted\nas a sister of Tattambo, Sarah “could not\nbe prevailed upon to quit the haunts of her\nlife with all their associations. She alone\nremains, like an old tree in a clearing, gnarled\nsomewhat, but sturdy and strong.”",
      "Tattambo married twice. The name\nof his first wife is unknown but they had a\nson, known by the Europeans as “Captain\nJohn”. Tattambo’s second wife was known as\n“Queen Mary”. These two people are buried\nwith Tattambo in the Murchison cemetery.\n“Queen Mary” and Tattambo had one child,\ncommonly known as “Jenny”. There will be\nstories about these members of Tattambo’s\nfamily in later Waranga Dreaming articles.",
      "Descendants of this line of the family\nare proud and strong Ngurai-illum Wurrung\npeople. In particular, the writer would like\nto acknowledge Ngurai-illum Wurrung Elder,\nUncle Vincent Peters, now a regular visitor\nto Murchison. Uncle Vin is an invaluable\ncontributor to these stories.",
      "<strong>Multilingual</strong>",
      "Kinship connections meant that Tattambo\nwould have been multi-lingual. His native\ntongue was the Ngurai-illum Wurrung\nlanguage. Connections with the other people\nin the Kulin nation (which comprised at least\nfive similar languages), meant that he would\nhave been able to communicate with people\nfrom all of those language groups.",
      "The languages spoken by near neighbours,\nthe Bangerang/Yorta Yorta (to their north)\nand the Barapa Barapa (west of the Campaspe\nRiver), were quite different to those spoken\nby members of the Kulin nation. There would\nhave been a necessity to learn the basics of\nthose languages to facilitate communication.",
      "Thirty years of contact with Europeans\nbefore his death in 1868 would also have\ngiven Tattambo a good working knowledge\nof English.",
      "<strong>Initiation</strong>",
      "When Tattambo was growing up, well\nbefore the impact of European colonisation,\nhe would have been taken through his\ninitiations by an Elder, known in some Kulin\nclans as a Caganguk. A Caganguk was a\nmentor, knowledgeable in the stories and\nculture of his people, who would work with\na group of boys, imparting knowledge and\npreparing them for their initiations.",
      "Pictures of Tattambo seem to indicate\nthat he had cicatrices on his body (as did his\nsecond wife Mary), some of which he may\nhave received at initiation. Cicatrices are scar\ntissue that forms from wounds. The cicatrices\non Tattambo’s body were from wounds\ndeliberately inflicted on the arms and upper\nbody. The wounds were kept open until the\nscar tissue formed, resulting in the familiar\nraised scars. These scars were a form of\ndecoration, also telling stories of their owner.",
      "<strong>Burial</strong>",
      "When Tattambo was buried in Murchison\ncemetery, it was apparently at his own\nrequest. As a mark of respect from the\nlocal community, the grave was “fenced\nin by a beautiful piece of iron railing, the\nworkmanship, we believe, of Mr Barratt. It\nis faced by the brass plate the old king wore\nround his neck…” Estimates of his age at\nthe time ranged between 70 and 80 years.",
