      "When Tattambo died on 1.1.1868, it was\nreckoned that he was at least 70. If this was\naccurate, then he was born prior to 1800.\nThis was well before any first contact with\nEuropeans on Ngurai-illum Wurrung country\nin northern Victoria.",
      "There was a short-lived European\nsettlement at Sullivan’s Cove (near presentday\nSorrento), from which convict William\nBuckley escaped in 1803. He lived with\nthe Wadawurrung people on the Bellarine\nPeninsula for over 30 years. In his travels\nwithin the Kulin Nation, Tattambo may have\nencountered Buckley, as members of both\nthe Ngurai-illum Wurrung and Wadawurrung\nattended cultural gatherings near what is now\nMelbourne CBD.",
      "Tattambo’s second wife is only\nremembered by her allotted European name,\n“Queen Mary”. Her birth name and clan are\nnot known. As was a common occurrence\nwith Aboriginal marriages, she was much\nyounger than Tattambo. When she died in\n1874, her age was estimated at 55-60, placing\nher date of birth before 1820. The report of\nher death said “Mary’s recollection dated\nback as far as the time of Buckley, ‘the wild\nwhite man’…” Perhaps Mary saw him at a\nKulin gathering?",
      "<strong>Family background</strong>",
      "When an Aboriginal woman was married\nto a Ngurai-illum Wurrung man, she had to\nleave her clan to live with her husband’s clan.\nMary was apparently from Wemba Wemba\ncountry, near present-day Murrabit. There is\na record of Tattambo and Mary visiting her\nrelatives there in 1866. It is not known when\nTattambo and Mary were married, but we do\nknow that their daughter Jenny (aka Jeannie\nor “Jinny”) was born around 1844. At this\ntime, the family may have had connections\nwith the Aboriginal Protectorate that was\noperating at Murchison.",
      "It is also unclear whether Tattambo’s first\nwife (name unknown) was deceased before\nhe married Mary. Some Aboriginal men had\nmore than one wife concurrently. There was\na son from the earlier marriage who was\nknown by the Europeans as Captain John.\nHe died in 1874, just before his step-mother\nMary, both being buried along with Tattambo\nat Murchison cemetery.",
      "<strong>A matriarch and elder</strong>",
      "Photographs of Mary showed that she had\na considerable amount of decorative scarring\non her upper abdomen and arms. It is unclear\nwhether this was standard practice for local\nwomen. Perhaps she already had the scarring\nprior to leaving Wemba Wemba country.",
      "After Tattambo died, Mary “unusually,\nassumed the role of Queen…Captain John\npreferred to keep a low profile.” It was\nreported that “for many years afterwards (i.e.\nafter Tattambo’s death) his widow, Queen\nMary…and a tribe of 100 blacks roamed\nabout the Waranga Shire and enjoyed the\nprotection of an aboriginal compound, which\nwas supervised for some time by William\nPhillips, on or near the site of the present\nMurchison Mechanics’ Institute, the state\nschool and the local churches.”",
      "This second quote was written in 1930,\nso is probably inaccurate on some counts. In\nparticular, it seems very unlikely than there\nwere 100 Aboriginal people in the area in\nthe 1860s. The Aboriginal Protectorate at\nMurchison had closed in 1853, and many of\nthe former residents had moved to reserves\nsuch as Coranderrk, or had dispersed to other\nareas. However, it could well be that Mary\nand a much smaller group, which included\nher step-son Captain John and her sister-inlaw\nSarah, continued to follow Ngurai-illum\nWurrung songlines into the early 1870s.",
      "<strong>Being on country</strong>",
      "The press of the day generally used\ncondescending language when writing about\nMary and her perceived ownership of the\nland. “The Queen-dowager Mary…usurped\nwithout contradiction the regal title…Mary\nwould spread her arms forth, and proclaim\naloud that all the land was hers. Poor Mary!”",
      "Another story written over a year earlier\nin 1873 reported “The township (Murchison)\nhas been honoured by a visit from royalty,\nQueen Mary, with her retinue, having lighted\nher camping-fire near the Farmers’ Hotel on\nthe Rushworth road.” This seems to indicate\nsome continuation of the seasonal movement\nof the remaining Aboriginal people around\nformer Ngurai-illum Wurrung country.",
