    "content": "<p>Writing about Aboriginal\nhistory is fraught, for many\nreasons. Not least of these is the\nfact that much of this history\nhas been passed down in an\noral tradition, while academic\nhistorians generally rely on\ndocumented material to verify\nfacts and tell their stories.\nIt is much harder to access\ninformation from oral sources,\nespecially where the impact of\ncolonisation has fragmented\nthis information and there are\nfew remaining descendants to\napproach.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is plenty of\nmaterial still to be found. With\nany history-related subject, it is\nincumbent on the author to totally\nimmerse him or herself in the\nexercise, by reading, watching,\nlistening, visiting, experiencing,\nexperimenting, recording and\ncollecting. By trying to do this\nwith an open mind, new insights\nand knowledge can be gained.\nSuch is the case when looking at\nAboriginal history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ignorance and naivety</strong></p>\n\n<p>Quite often, this process\ncan begin from a position of\nignorance and naivety but can\nturn into a learning experience.\nFor instance, one could begin by\npicking easy targets. You could\ndecide that because the local\narea has a recognised former\nAboriginal axe-head quarry,\nwhich has been studied quite\na lot, you could go and have a\nlook. Recent Waranga Dreaming\nstories have referred to the\nquarry on the Mt Camel range,\nwhere greenstone was mined\nfor use in axe-heads, spearheads\nand blades. A well-intentioned\n(albeit ignorant) visitor might\nbe excused for picking up a few\npieces of greenstone to take home\nto study and experiment with -\nafter all, there is plenty there.</p>\n\n<p>To further one’s interest in\nthe subject, you might go on\nan excursion to Mt William,\nnear Lancefield. Mt William is\nrenowned as the most famous\nof several greenstone quarries\nin Victoria, and stone from\nthere has been traded over vast\ndistances. A Wurundjeri Elder\ncould show you around the Mt\nWilliam site. They would no\ndoubt make it clear that nothing\nshould ever be removed from the\nsite. Obviously, if every visitor\ndid that, the cultural value of\nthe site would be compromised.\nGulp!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The return</strong></p>\n\n<p>No doubt someone who had\nremoved something from such a\nsite would then resolve to return\nthe pieces of stone to where\nthey had been collected. In\nhindsight, it was a foolish thing\nto do. Especially by someone\nwho could recall being outraged\nat a person who had fossicked\naround at Gallipoli and collected\na whole lot of items to take home\nand make a display. This was\npretty much the same thing in a\ndifferent setting.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine this – our no-longer\nso naive culprit travels to the Mt\nCamel range to return the stones.\nIt is a filthy day. Driving up the\nsmall country track around the\nbase of the mountain, it is pouring\nrain. As the car comes to a stop\nat the base of the mountain, the\nrain suddenly stops.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A brilliant rainbow</strong></p>\n\n<p>The top of the range is a\nfairly stiff half-hour climb from\nwhere the car is parked. Rain\nstill threatens, but the mission is\ndeemed to be important. Halfway\ninto the ascent, the sky clears to a\nbright azure blue, and a brilliant\nrainbow appears over the plains\nto the east of the Mt Camel range.\nThe end of the rainbow is in the\nmiddle of Ngurai-illum Wurrung\ncountry. It stays that way as the\nclimb is completed. The stones\nare returned as close as possible\nto where they had been picked up\nand a whispered apology made.</p>\n\n<p>On the descent, a mob of\nkangaroos move fluidly across\nthe range. A bird of prey soars\nmajestically and calls in the\ndistance. At the same time as the\ncar is reached the rain starts to\nbucket down again. In the safety\nof the car it is possible to sit\nquietly and reflect with some awe\non what has just happened. There\nis a strong sense of goodwill for\n“doing the right thing” - a feeling\nthat the earlier ignorance has\nbeen forgiven. And to quote a\nterm that a Yorta Yorta man used\nat a recent funeral, a feeling of\nbeing “embraced”. Some people\nmight even call this a spiritual\nexperience.</p>"
