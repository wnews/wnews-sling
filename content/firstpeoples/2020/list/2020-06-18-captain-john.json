      "The Aboriginal man called “Captain\nJohn” by the Europeans was the son of\nTattambo and his first wife. We do not know\nJohn’s Aboriginal birth name or where he was\nborn. When he died in 1874, it was estimated\nat the time that he was in his late 40s. If true,\nthat would place his birth date in the mid to\nlate 1820s. “Mr William Phillips, the oldest\nresident in the town, remembers him as a boy\nof 12 or 13, when the Protectorate was first\nestablished under Mr Le Soeuf in 1839.”",
      "Being born prior to the European\nincursion into Ngurai-illum Wurrung country\nmeant that as a boy, John would have had a\nvery traditional upbringing. The clan of his\nparents was based on the Campaspe River\nsouth of Elmore, but travelled extensively\nto the east, beyond the Goulburn River. All\nchildren born in the Gunung Willam clan,\nlike John, became members of the Waa, or\ncrow moiety, so this bird would have been an\nimportant totem for John.",
      "<strong>Initiation</strong>",
      "At about the time that John would have\nnormally been going through his formal\ninitiation, the world of the Ngurai-illum\nWurrung was in total upheaval. European\ncolonisers rapidly moved into their country\nin the wake of the 1836 Major Mitchell\nexpedition. John could potentially have been\na witness to some of the massacres that took\nplace, particularly on the Campaspe in the\nlate 1830s.",
      "It is unclear whether John went through\nan initiation process in the usual way, because\nof these disruptions. Instruction was given\nto young teenage boys by a mentor, usually\nfrom within the clan. The mentor needed to\nhave accumulated considerable knowledge\nto pass on, so was usually a respected older\nman. The initiation culminated in ceremony\nat a location regularly used for such events.",
      "<strong>Later years</strong>",
      "A writer for the Waranga Chronicle\nclaimed that Captain John said the first white\nmen that he had seen were in Major Mitchell’s\nparty, as they passed through northern\nVictoria in 1836. When the Aboriginal\nProtectorate was established in 1839, it seems\nthat Captain John frequented the station with\nother members of the Ngurai-illum Wurrung\nclans.",
      "As he grew older, he was employed by the\npolice as a tracker in Gippsland. There was\ngenerally no love lost between the people of\nthe Kulin nation (of which John was member)\nand the Gippsland Aboriginal people known\nas the Kurnai. Apparently, John tended to\nbe overenthusiastic in the performance of\nhis duties, preferring to shoot first and ask\nquestions later.",
      "One such incident resulted in his own\narrest. However, when he was handcuffed\nand being taken to a place of incarceration\nto answer the charges, he escaped by diving\ninto a river and swimming away underwater.\nHe “…appeared not again on the confines of\ncivilised life till his offence was forgotten.”1\nHis access to firearms during his time with\nthe police meant that he became an excellent\nshot, and as a result probably abandoned his\ntraditional weapons.",
      "<strong>Family life</strong>",
      "When he resurfaced along the Goulburn\nRiver, Captain John spent most of his time in\nthe districts of Avenel, Seymour, Nagambie\nand Murchison, particularly the latter.1 His\nwife was known as Biddy. They had a\ndaughter (Jeannie/Jenny) who was born\naround 1844, and a son, Johnny/Johnnie.",
      "In winter 1874, while camping on the\nGoulburn at Murchison, Biddy’s mia mia\ncaught fire. She was the only occupant, and\nwas quite severely burned. She was nursed\nback to health by Jeannie and an unnamed\nmember of the Murchison community.2 After\nJohn died in 1874, the remaining members\nof his immediate family went to live at\nCoranderrk station near Healesville.",
      "It seems that Captain John was quite a\ncharacter. “There was a humorous twinkle\nabout the Captain’s eye that seems to intimate\nthat he rather enjoys life.”4 When he died, it\nwas reported that “The deceased had a great\ndeal of native dignity in his composition, and\nhe was a true gentleman on many points.”",
