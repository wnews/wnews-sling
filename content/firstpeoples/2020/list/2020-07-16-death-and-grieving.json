      "The previous Waranga Dreaming story\ncited William Thomas, a former Assistant\nProtector of Aborigines, providing details of\nwhat he thought were standard practices after\nthe death of an Aboriginal person. It is worth\nnoting that practices varied widely across\nAustralia prior to European colonisation –\nperhaps even within Ngurai-illum Wurrung\ncountry - and included both burial and\ncremation.",
      "What Thomas does not mention in his\nstory is that the time of death and grieving was\noften accompanied by most intense keening\nby the Aboriginal women. Unlike many\npresent-day funerals, grief was displayed\nopenly and unashamedly and could also\ninclude mourners self-inflicting themselves\nwith wounds.",
      "<strong>Keening</strong>",
      "When we think of keening as a way of\nexpressing grief, we tend to think of the Irish.\nIn his book “My Father’s Wake”, Irish author\nKevin Toolis writes – “In the narrow room\nthe old man lay close to death….In the bare\nwhitewashed room, no bigger than a prison\ncell, 10 watchers – the mná caointe – the\nwailing women, were calling out, keening,\nsharing the last moments of the life, and the\ndeath, of this man. My father. Sonny…In the\ntight, enclosed space, the sound of this chorus\nof voices boomed off the walls, the ceiling,\nlouder and louder, reverberating, verse after\nverse, on and on, cradling Sonny into death.\nThis death so open, so different from the\ndenial of the Anglo-Saxon world would, too,\nbe Sonny’s last parental lesson. How to die.”",
      "Similarly, keening was an important part\nof Aboriginal burial practice. When “Captain\nJohn” died in 1874, the Waranga Chronicle\nreported “As a rosy-tipped morning dawns on\nMonday a wail is heard from the native camp\non the banks of the Goulburn at Murchison…\nHis lubra (sic) mourns, and two other women\nfrom a neighbouring camp join in the\ncoronach”.1 (Coronach = part of a round of\nkeening, the traditional improvised singing at\na death, wake or funeral).",
      "We can only guess who the “two other\nwomen” would be, but most likely candidates\nwould be his stepmother “Queen Mary” and\nhis Auntie “Sarah”. In the small Aboriginal\ncommunity still living on the Goulburn\nRiver at the time, they were two of the few\nremaining older women who would be\nmost familiar with the traditional songs and\nchants that had been passed down over many\ngenerations.",
      "<strong>Sorry cuts</strong>",
      "Another way of displaying grief was\nthrough self-inflicted wounds, often cutting\nthe arms with a sharp object. This is quite\ndifferent from a practice where a person may\nself-harm as the result of negative feelings\nthat they have about themselves or aspects of\ntheir life. Instead, it is part of “ceremony”\nor “sorry business”, with an example being\nsorry cuts “practised as a sign of grief for the\nloss of a family member”.",
      "There doesn’t appear to be any\ndocumented evidence of Ngurai-illum\nWurrung people engaging in “sorry cuts”.\nThe few photographs that we have of the\npeople do not make it clear either, although\na well-known photograph of “King Charles”\nTattambo appears to indicate that his arms are\nhighly scarred. These scars may have been\ndecorative, as were those clearly featured\non the shoulders and breasts of his second\nwife, “Queen Mary”. “Sorry cuts” are quite\ndifferent to this decorative scarring, instead\nbeing a way of demonstrating grief.",
      "<strong>Sorry business</strong>",
      "The grieving process was (and still is)\ntaken extremely seriously by Aboriginal\npeople, so there is no reason to suggest that it\nwould have been any different for the Nguraiillum\nWurrung people in centuries gone by.\nExtended kinship relationships meant that the\ndeceased was very closely linked to a large\nnumber of people. It was important for those\npeople to all get together at the time of the\ndeath and take their time to work through the\nearly stages of the grieving process. This\nis generally referred to these days as “sorry\nbusiness”.",
      "Like the Irish experience mentioned\nabove, deaths were treated openly, and grief\ndisplayed publicly by Aboriginal people.\nPerhaps there is another lesson to be learned\nhere, rather than the traditional reserve we\ntend to display in response to a death.",
