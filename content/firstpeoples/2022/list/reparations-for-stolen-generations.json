      "The Victorian government has recently approved a reparation package which recognises the suffering caused by the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families.  Members of what is now referred to as “the Stolen Generation” can apply for a payment of up to $100,000.  There is estimated to be around 1000 Victorians who may be eligible, part of some 33,600 surviving members of the Stolen Generation across Australia.\n",
      "Reparations are a way of recognising the “lasting suffering caused by the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families by the government and other agencies.”  Analysis undertaken by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) released last year found that survivors suffer a high level of poverty and illness, including mental illness.\n",
      "Premier Daniel Andrews said “This is not a cost to the budget, this is an investment in justice and truth and a shared journey together — true reconciliation.  To steal, not just people, but to steal from them their identity … to take away from them language and cultural practice, to take away from them family, to take away from them Country is a shameful, shameful thing…When we right a wrong from the past, we are all enhanced by that,” he said.\n",
      "Victoria has already set up a First Peoples’ Assembly to advance a treaty with the state.  Members of the Assembly played an integral role in advising on and setting up the reparations package.  Assembly co-chair and Bangerang and Wiradjuri elder Aunty Geraldine Atkinson said although the harm caused by the Stolen Generations could never be repaired, the redress scheme would help address the disadvantage that resulted.\n",
      "“The damage inflicted on our people when government authorities ripped families apart and stole our children runs across generations and the disadvantage it caused is ongoing,” Aunty Geri said.  “I don’t believe there is anything that can heal that trauma or ever repay that loss but the scheme announced today will go some way to helping people address the disadvantage caused by the inhumane practices our people have been subjected to.”\n",
      "The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service said the scheme was an important step in addressing inequality for Aboriginal people, but its implementation must be done with care.  “Many Aboriginal Victorians eligible for the Stolen Generations Redress Scheme are rightly hesitant to engage in government processes,” the service said in a press release.  “It will be vital to the success of the scheme that the Victorian Government work closely with community and Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations to ensure the scheme is delivered with open ears and hearts and in a culturally safe way.”\n",
