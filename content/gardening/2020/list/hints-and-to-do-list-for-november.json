      "<strong>Must do:</strong> Calcium is the powerhouse of the soil. To prevent plants such as tomatoes and zucchini getting destructive blossom-end rot, apply agricultural lime in powder form. Apply the lime then water in with molasses (1 tablespoon per 9 litre watering can) to also help feed soil organisms. If a calcium boost is needed urgently, use liquid calcium watered directly on the soil around plants.",
