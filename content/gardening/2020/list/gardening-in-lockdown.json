      "<strong>No Dig Gardening..</strong> with the ideal growing conditions for our\ngardens with balmy days and a good start\nto the year with some decent rains. Mild\ntemperatures over the last month or so have\ngiven us ideal conditions for new plantings\nin the garden and plenty\nof daylight hours to tidy\nup all those areas we have\nbeen meaning to get to but\nhaven’t had the time ....\nso the upside of being in\nlockdown is plenty of time\nto get stuck into it and that’s\nexactly what we have been\ndoing in our garden and\nloving it !",
      "It has given me time to\nreflect on why we moved\nhere in the first place to\ngrow our own vegetables,\nherbs and fruits and to\npreserve what we can to\nlast throughout the year, but\nsomehow that had got lost in our busy lives\nand I am hoping that everyone has a different\noutlook on our choices now that we have\nbeen made to slow down and take stock of\nwhat really is important. And what we really\nneed and want back. ......Food for thought....",
      "If you are new to growing vegetables and\nherbs and are struggling to get started there\nis a great easy way to achieve fresh delicious\norganic vegetables and herbs without too\nmuch manual work.....it’s the No Dig\nGarden....yes no dig !",
      "To create a small,\nmedium or large patch\nin your garden you will\nneed some recycled\ncardboard boxes (\nall tape, staples etc\nremoved), good weed\nfree compost, some\nseedlings, and some\ntype of edging ....it can\nbe loose bricks old bits\nof concrete anything\nthat will hold the shape\nof your bed together .",
      "Lay the cardboard\nin a position which will\nget six hours’ sunlight,\nas vegetables and herbs\nneed sun to thrive. You can lay this over a\npatch of weedy lawn so long as you overlap\nthe cardboard so no light gets into the ground.\nWet down the cardboard if you like but it’s\nnot necessary. It will break down over time\nafter the weeds have died. I prefer to put a\ncouple of layers of cardboard down to ensure\na good die off of weeds.",
      "Layer organic compost over the cardboard\nto a depth of about 8 - 10 inches and firm\ndown so you get enough compost in the bed\nfor growing. Grab some vegetable and herb\nseedlings and plant into the compost and\nwater in, making sure you space them at the\nrequired width apart and you should have\ngreat healthy seedlings producing bountiful\nfresh food in no time!",
      "I used to grow my vegetables by this\nmethod when in rental properties many years\nago with great success!",
      "There are some great videos to step you\nthrough on YouTube if you need a bit extra\nhelp....",
