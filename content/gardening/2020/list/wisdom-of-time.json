      "Time is a great giver of wisdom; it allows\nyou to make mistakes and then hopefully\nlearn from them. This is certainly the case\nwith gardening where, sooner or later, your\nmistakes become very evident. However it\ndoes help if you have some of this wisdom\nsimply told to you so here are some little\ngardening pearls of wisdom.",
      "While weeding is sometimes good\ntherapy, mostly it is just a pain. To counter\nour weed problems many of us laid down\nweed mat and covered it with a good layer\nof mulch. It worked as far as the weeds go\nbut it created other\nproblems. The weed\nmat with a thick thatch\nof often hydrophobic\nmulch was impenetrable\nto water. The underlying\nsoil dried out and\ncompacted. There was\nno transfer of humus\ninto the soil. In effect,\nthe soil died. Even with\nan irrigation system\nmany plants struggled\nand often new plants\ndied or failed to thrive.\nA moderate, layer of\nmulch is almost essential\nin Rushworth, but\nmake sure that it is thin\nenough for our precious\nrain to penetrate. An\noccasional handful or\ntwo of wetting agent is\na big help.",
      "It is entirely possible\nto build clay into garden\nsoil. It takes time. Initially a good dose of\ngypsum and plenty of compost needs to be\ndug in. The initial plantings should be quite\nhardy types. When planting dig large holes\nand really break up the clay and use plenty\nof seaweed solution. Over the following few\nyears keep adding compost and building\nup the soil and you will develop soil good\nenough to plant most things in, but remember\nthe clay is still underneath.",
      "It is also quite possible to grow a garden\nin areas that are in a dark and gloomy spot.\nSimply plant what will tolerate the cooler\nlow-light conditions. It is a case of planting\nwhat the position dictates rather than what\nyou would like to grow.",
      "An irrigation system on a timer is a great\nthing, but have you ever tried to program one\nof those expensive electronic timers? Unless\nyou have a tech savvy grandchild to do it for\nyou it may be better to get a mechanical twist\nstyle timer. You will need to turn it on but at\nleast you can use it. They are also cheaper and\nseem to last longer.",
      "Some plants are quite fussy when it comes\nto soil ph. It is cheaper to get a soil testing kit\nor take a soil sample into your nursery to be\ntested than it is to buy plants and watch them\ndie.",
      "In ‘difficult’ parts of the garden, resist\nthe temptation to plant vigorous bomb-proof\nplants. While they may thrive they may also\nspread to where you don’t\nwant them. Later when\nyou finally get around to\ndeveloping that “difficult”\narea they will be almost\nimpossible to eradicate. If\nyou insist upon planting\nthem check to ensure they\nare not classified as noxious.",
      "Check all new plants\nfor insects and disease\nbefore you plant them. This\nis especially true for the\nfreebies that your gardening\nfriends give to you.",
      "Every now and then we\nall have plants that start to\ngo downhill. If it is a shrub\nor tree, cut of a little of the\ndying part of the plant and\ncheck for termites. They are\nrife in Rushworth. Whether\nthe termites are the cause of\nthe plant’s failure or whether\nthey are taking advantage of\nthe weakened plant is a moot\npoint. If there are termites in the plant, treat\nwith powder insecticide (cut and immediately\ndust) or remove the plant entirely. Then\ncheck other plants and buildings for signs of\ntermites. Some plants are very well protected\nwith thorns or spines. Bougainvillaeas,\nyuccas, many grevilleas, cacti and of course\nroses, are just some examples. They may be\nlovely to look at but are murder to prune, cutback\nor remove. Try to find thornless varieties\nto plant.",
      "Over the last few months many of us\nhave been swept up in a flurry of gardening;\na good, healthy activity when keeping away\nfrom the world. We just need to accept that\nnot all of the gardening we have done in this\ntime will bear the desired results and that we\nwill, in time, gain more wisdom.",
