      "As very amateur home gardeners\n(speaking from personal experience) most of\nus know that crop rotation is something that is\ngoing to help us grow healthy happy veggies\nthat we (instead of very hungry caterpillars\nand other pests) get to enjoy munching on.",
      "Knowing is one thing, but being\norganised enough to do more than not plant\nthe tomatoes in the same bed as last year,\nis another. However, we don’t need to have\na degree in agro-science or horticulture to\nunderstand the common sense theory that\ndifferent crops use up different nutrients\nin the soil, so it might be better to give that\npatch a rest from this year’s lodgers and offer\nit a crop with different tastes.",
      "A useful fact to remember is that while\nmany vegetables remove many and various\nnutrients from the soil during their growing\nperiods, a number also replace nutrients (eg\nbeans, peas and other legumes). So by varying\nwhat we plant, and what type of crop follows\nanother, we can ensure that our vegies get\nwhat they need from the soil… and we get\nwhat we need from our vegies!",
      "Essentially, each area should be planted\nwith a different plant family each season\n(generally every six months), to help avoid\nany nasty pest and disease outbreaks.",
      "The other reason for this type of planting\nsequence is that some plants are referred to\nas “heavy” feeders, while others are “light”\nfeeders. By introducing a crop rotation\nsystem, we can estimate the potential levels\nof soil nutrients remaining in the plot and\nplant up accordingly.",
      "So a key basic for crop rotation is a little\nbit of knowledge about plant families.",
      "<strong>Know your vegies. How hungry\nare they?</strong>",
      "<ul><li>Fruity things, such as cucumbers and\ntomatoes, are heavy feeders</li><li>Brassicas (cabbages, etc) are medium\nfeeders.</li><li>Rooty things, eg onions and carrots, are\nlight feeders.</li><li>Legumes (beans, etc) are non-feeders\n(they can fix their own nitrogen).</li><li>Leafy things (lettuce, spinach, silverbeet,\netc) are pretty neutral - don’t have much\nimpact on the soil and are not too fussy.</li></ul>",
      "So, alternating light and heavy feeders,\na six year crop rotation (if you have an\nextensive vegie garden) might be:",
      "<ol><li>Legumes (beans, peas etc).</li><li>Brassicas (cabbage, broccolietc).</li><li>roots:onions, leeks</li><li>cucumber, pumpkin, etc</li><li>roots: carrots</li><li>tomatoes, potatoes</li></ol>",
      "But of course you might not have the\nspace, time or energy for such a minimarket\ngarden approach. So to make it more\nmanageble, you might:",
      "<ul><li>Combine some things: eg all the ‘roots’.</li><li>Omit some things: eg never plant\nbrassicas (did you really want cabbages and\nbrussel sprouts anyway?)</li><li>The most common solution: plant a\ncool season crop (e.g. brassicas) followed\nby a warm season crop (e.g. tomatoes or\ncucumbers) into a single bed over the course\nof a year.</li></ul>"
