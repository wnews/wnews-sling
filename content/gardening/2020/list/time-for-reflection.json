      "Taking time to reflect is an important part of gardening. It is a time to think\nabout what is working in the garden and what is not and a time to make plans\nfor your garden’s future.

      "In my garden I have had some real successes. The blue fescue really took\noff, in spite of being trimmed by a resident rabbit. The nearby weeping wattle\nhas also done well, as did the leafless acacia. The yarrow under the new pergola\nthrived over the hot months, albeit with regular light watering Alas there were\na few fatalities among the newly planted. The upshot of this is that we need\nto plant earlier so that plants\ncan become more established\nbefore the summer. In some\ninstances we may have needed\nto buy larger, more resilient\nplants and we need to plant\nheat/drought tolerant plants\nthat can still tolerate the odd\nfrost.",
      "It is clear that we need\nto do a serious rethink as to\nwhat we plant in our gardens.\nPlants which can not only\ntolerate but thrive in the hot,\ndry summers are now essential\nif we are to continue gardening\nin Rushworth. It would be good\nthing for Rushworth gardeners\nif we can share our successes\nby putting together a list of\nthose plants that will do well\nin our changing climate. What\nis needed from all you keen\ngardeners is to send a list of\nthe plants that have not just\nsurvived but thrived over the\nlast summer. Common names,\nbotanical names or nursery\nnames of the plants is all that is\nneeded and a brief description\ncan be sent in to the Waranga\nNews to be collated into a plant\nlist available to the public.",
