      "The onset of winter brings the striking\nflowers of the many Banksia species to the\nfore.",
      "These striking and attractive Australian\nnative plants have tough, often serrated\nleaves and large, erect cones of stiff flowers in\nshades of greenish-white, yellow and orange\nthrough to pink and red. Banksias range from\nground covers, low growing shrubs to small\ntrees and are great plants to attract bees and\nnectar feeding birds into the garden. Banksias\nalso make great cut flowers indoors where\nthey’ll release their honey scent.",
      "Banksias also\nproduce very distinctive\nwoody seed pods\nwhich you’ll instantly\nrecognise as the big bad\nBanksia men if you’ve\nread the children’s\nbook “Snugglepot &\nCuddlepie” by May\nGibbs.",
      "There are more than\n170 species of banksias\nwith all but one being\nendemic to Australia\n.Probably the most\ncommon species grown\nin the home garden\nare Banksia spinulosa,\nBanksia speciosa and\nBanksia ericifolia while the cultivars ‘Giant\nCandles’ and ‘Birthday Candles’ are also\npopular with their prolific flowering.",
      "<strong>How to grow Banksias</strong>",
      "Choose a sunny position where the soil\nis free draining to avoid them developing\nroot rot. They are quite happy in sandy soils\nbut will appreciate a little organic matter\nbeing added. Clay soils will definitely need\nimproving with gypsum and you should also\nraise the garden bed to assist with drainage.\nApply liquid seaweed in the first few weeks\nto help settle the banksia into its new home.",
      "Banksias lack a main taproot and can take\ntwo years to fully establish themselves. Keep\nan eye on them for their first two summers\nand provide extra water during hot periods if\nneeded. After that they’ll be quite drought\nresistant.",
      "If you want to grow banksias from seed\nthe good news is the seeds are very viable\nand will easily germinate in a few days.\nExtracting the seed from the cone however is\nthe tricky part! They are deep inside the cone\nand the capsules only open after exposure\nto high temperatures eg bushfires. To mimic\nthis place the cone in an oven for 1-2 hours at\n100-150 degrees celcius and the capsules will\nopen releasing the seed. Watch that the cone\ndoesn’t catch alight.",
      "Sow the seed either\ndirectly into a garden bed\nor in very free draining\nnative potting mix. Water\nin with liquid seaweed and\nbefore you know it, you\nwill have baby banksias!",
      "<strong>Fertilising Banksias</strong>",
      "Banksias have\nspecial roots called\nproteoid roots which\nhelp them to grow in our\nlow nutrient Australian\nsoils. As such they\nrequire little fertilising\nand are particularly\nsensitive to high levels of\nphosphorous, especially\nwhen they are young. Once or twice a year,\napply a certified organic fertiliser which is\nlabelled safe for natives or has a phosphorus\ncontent less than 2%.",
      "If you have young plants that you want to\npush along then apply liquid seaweed every\n2-4 weeks as this are safe for all natives.",
      "<strong>Pruning Banksias</strong>",
      "Generally banksias require little pruning.\nSimply trim off any dead branches which\nmay appear and prune back to restrict the\nsize/shape if needed. Finished flower spikes\nleft to age on the plant become quite striking\nin their own right."
