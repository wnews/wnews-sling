      "Some people are known to be\nmorning people, I, myself have\nalways been known as a bit of\na night owl. I find the seclusion\nand peacefulness of the later\nhours soothing and a lot goes on\nout there with our native critters\nwhile most of us are sleeping.",
      "Many of our Australian\ncreatures are nocturnal, therefore\nare not really thought about and\npeople do not even realise they\nare there.",
      "Sugar Gliders certainly fit\ninto this category. They are\nquite small, quick and agile and\ncatching a glimpse of them at\nnight is something special.",
      "Sugar Gliders are in the\npossum family and have the\namazing ability to glide through\nour forests. They are capable of\ngliding due to a thin membrane\nwhich is attached from each of\nits wrists to each ankle. When\nleaping from a tree, gliders\noutstretch their limbs, spreading\nthis furred membrane out like\na tiny paraglider, which allows\nthem to glide up to 50m or\nmore in one glide! We call this\nmembrane the patagium. As\nthis motion is a true glide and\nis not flying, over long gliding\ndistances the glide has a steady\nfalling gradient so they will land\nlower than the height they began\ntheir glide.",
      "Their remarkable fluffy tail\nis as long as their body and is\nprehensile, enabling the glider\nto hold and hang off branches\nas well as acting as a rudder in\ncombination with changing the\nangle and position of their limbs\nand membrane during gliding to\nsteer and change direction.",
      "Sugar Gliders are expert\nclimbers possessing sharp claws\nand are able to run up and down\ntree trunks and along branches\nwith ease.",
      "Males are quite larger than\nfemales and it is common for\none male to roost with several\nfemales in a hollow. Squirrel\nGliders require hollows to camp\nin during the day and also seek\nrefuge in at night from predators\nand extreme cold. During cold\nweather they have the ability to\nconserve energy by going into\ntorpor. Torpor is a state where an\nanimal lowers its metabolism to\nconserve precious energy. They\ndo this on colder days or rainy\ndays where food may not be easy\nto come by and can remain in\ntorpor for up to 13 hours on these\ndays.",
      "In winter Sugar Gliders live\nin large groups for warmth but\nthese larger groups will break\nup into smaller ones during the\nwarmer months.",
      "In Northern parts of Australia\nbreeding can happen all year\nround but in Southern parts of\nAustralia, our gliders tend to\nbreed from August to December.\nBeing a marsupial, the young are\nborn very undeveloped and have\nto crawl through their mother’s\nfur into the pouch on their own\nafter being born. Sugar gliders\nusually have two young which\nspend around 70 days in the\npouch and another 50 days in the\n‘nest’ before emerging to forage\nwith their mother. Male gliders\nactively help look after the babes\nand help line the hollow nest with\neucalyptus leaves.",
      "At around 7 months of age the\nyoung become fully independent\nand will cease foraging with their\nmother.",
      "Although Sugar Gliders in\ncaptivity can live up to 12 years,\nlifespan in the wild is only around\n5 years old.",
      "Sugar Gliders can make\nsome pretty cool sounds. One\nof their calls reminds me of a\nsmall yapping dog, short, high\nyips. The other is a sound that is\ndifficult to describe…it is almost\na mechanical grating sound\nwhich doesn’t fit the glider’s\ncute, fluffy appearance.",
      "Diet obviously consists\nlargely of nectar, sap and pollen,\nhence the name Sugar Glider,\nbut they are also ferocious little\nhunters of insects and even\nsmall birds! It is believed that a\nsingle Sugar Glider colony can\nconsume up to 200 kg of insects\nin a year! I have seen them with\nlarge spiders in their tiny little\nhands, munching on them as\nthough a delicacy.",
      "These little animals are not\nconsidered endangered like\ntheir closest relative the Squirrel\nGlider, which we also have in\nthis area, but they face many\nthreats to their existence. Habitat\nloss and fragmentation is a big\none. These little gliders prefer\nforest with wattle present in\nthe understory as this provides\na winter food source. Hollows\nare also a vital element for their\nsurvival.",
      "The common reason Sugar\nGliders come into care at\nBohollow is due to cat attack\nand barbed wire entanglements.\nBarbed wire is a real danger for\nour wildlife and some species\nget caught in it more than others.\nSadly, our gliders are one of\nthem. Barbed wire can cause\nhorrific damage, usually to their\npatagial membrane and is often\na death sentence for these little\npossums.",
      "If you have barbed wire\nfencing on your property,\nplease consider removing it and\nreplacing with ordinary fencing\nwire. The damage we see on a\ncontinual basis from all kinds\nof critters getting caught on this\nwire is truly heartbreaking and\nin cases where we are able to\ntreat and fix the damage, the bird\nor mammal often dies purely\nthrough the horrific stress and\npain of being caught on the rotten\nstuff for hours before they are\nfound and rescued.",
      "Sugar gliders also have quite\na few natural predators. Birds\nsuch as owls and kookaburras,\ngoannas, snakes and in areas they\nstill exist, quolls, will all predate\non gliders.",
      "We have two captive bred\nSugar Gliders here at Bohollow\nas part of our team of educational\nanimals and they are delightful\nlittle creatures to be around. They\nassist in our teachings of habitat\nand conservation.",
      "So if you are a night owl, take\ntime out to listen and look around\nyour garden and you may be lucky\nenough to spot one of these little\ngliders on their nightly forage.\nOur bushland and gardens can be\nbusier than you think while most\nof us are sleeping."
