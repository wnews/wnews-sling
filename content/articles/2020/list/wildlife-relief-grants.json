      "WIRES and Landcare Australia have announced\n64 environmental groups across\nthe country will benefit from a landmark\n$1.185million grants partnership supporting\nrecovery of wildlife habitats impacted\nby bushfire and drought.",
      "Launched in April 2020, the WIRES\nLandcare Australia Wildlife Relief and\nRecovery Grants is a pioneering alliance\nbetween two not-for-profits that have been\npart of the fabric of local communities for\nover 30 years.",
      "Made possible due to the unprecedented\nvolume of donations to WIRES from within\nAustralia and around the world following the\nBlack Summer bushfires, this grants program\nwill support wide-ranging regeneration\nprojects focused on restoring habitat impacted\nby the bushfires.",
      "Projects include rainforest revegetation,\ninstallation of nest boxes to replace destroyed\ntree hollows for decimated native species,\nfeeding programs for endangered wildlife,\nmanagement of invasive weeds, erosion\ncontrol and protection of our waterways and\naquatic habitat.",
      "WIRES CEO Leanne Taylor said\n“Regeneration of impacted habitat is key to\nsupporting our vulnerable native wildlife.”\n“This program is an excellent example\nof how we can use donations to support\ngrassroot community organisations to make a\nreal difference and deliver positive outcomes\nfor our wildlife now and in the future.”",
      "Landcare Australia CEO Dr Shane\nNorrish applauded the overwhelming\nresponse to the grants program, citing the\nextraordinary commitment landholders and\ncommunity environmental groups display\ntowards the relief and recovery of bushfire\nand drought-impacted regions across the\ncountry, particularly when Australia is facing\none of its most challenging times in recent\nhistory.",
      "Dr Norrish said: “While the nation has\nbeen impacted by the worst global health\npandemic in living memory, effectively halting\non-ground bushfire and drought regeneration\nactivity, the desire and motivation to get on\nwith the recovery effort has been astounding,\nand the demand for assistance and the quality\nof applications so great, WIRES provided\nadditional funding to support more groups\nthan originally contemplated.”",
      "Dr Norrish added: “Landcare and\nenvironmental community groups need\nfinancial support to help with habitat\nrestoration, regeneration and building\nresilience of bushland while providing\nprotection for threatened species and other\nnative animals which ultimately, enhances\nconservation outcomes and connects\ncommunities.”"
