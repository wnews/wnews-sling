      "A small COVID-19-compliant\nmeeting took place recently\non the shores of Lake Cooper\nbetween people with local\nwaterways interests.",
      "CLAPIC (Cornella Local\nArea Plan) and CCAG (Corop\nCommunity Action Group)\nrepresentatives met with\nTaungurung, GBCMA, VWSA\nand ‘Camp Kookaburra’ in\nan exercise intended to exchange\nunderstandings about how the\ngroups might all best fi t and work\ntogether in the future.",
      "It is now recognised and\naccepted that Lake Cooper\n(contrary to the experience of\nanyone under seventy) is, in fact,\nan ephemeral lake and, being\noccasionally dry or with little\nwater, is its natural state.",
      "With the recent offi cial\nrecognition of the Taungurung\nas the traditional owners,\nand DEWLP (Department of\nEnvironment, Land, Water and\nPlanning) as the responsible\ngovernment agency after years of\nuncertainty on both counts, it is\nhoped that a new era of better and\nmore enlightened management\nof the lake and its foreshore will\nfollow."
