      "The ABC’s investigative program Four\nCorners took on a different format last\nMonday night when Stan Grant presented\nan intensely personal reflection on being\nIndigenous in contemporary Australia. He\nreveals the racist slurs he endured as a black\nkid growing up in white Australia, and gives\nvoice to other Indigenous Australians about\ntheir lives and the impact of George Floyd’s\nmurder on their own situation.",
      "“I Can’t Breathe” is a powerful and moving\nviewing experience to be recommended for\nanyone who seeks a better understanding of\nAboriginal lived experience - and even more\nstrongly recommmended for anyone who,\nlike Stan Grant’s school friend, says “Why do\nyou have to always talk about that Abo shit?”\n(This was after he had told the class about his\nfamily background.)",
      "“I Can’t Breathe” is available on ABC\niview and at <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/i-cant-breathe/12452444\" target=\"_blank\">abc.net.au/4corners</a>"
