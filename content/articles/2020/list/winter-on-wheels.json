      "During the school holidays, some members of the Ford family did a two-week bicycle tour which incorporated travel in\nthe Rushworth area.",
      "The family is now looking\nforward to the day when there\nare rail trails all the way from\nRushworth to Murchison,\nRushworth to Stanhope-Girgarre\nand maybe even Rushworth to\nColbo. Rail trails are a great way\nto bring people into small towns,\nwhere they can help to stimulate\nthe local economy.",
      "During their two-week tour,\nthe family stayed mainly at free\ncamping sites. (It would be\nfantastic if Rushworth had such\na site - a guaranteed way to get\npeople to stop over in this area.)",
      "The family comprised Sam\nand Krista, and their two kids,\nBanjo (10) and Daisy (7). They\nare experienced bike tourists,\nhaving ridden through Chile\nand Argentina in 2019. On this\noccasion, their bikes included\na tandem (Sam and Daisy) and\ntwo standard bikes (Krista and\nBanjo). An average day was\nabout 40 kilometres, mainly\ntravelling on back roads. They\ncarried all their food, water and\ncamping gear in panniers on\ntheir bikes. Their starting and\nfinishing point was their home\njust out of Woodend.",
      "Here is part of their blog,\nstarting at Mia Mia and\ncovering parts of the local\nWaranga area.",
      "“The next day is full of entirely\nnew roads. In the morning, they\nwind back and forth through\nfarms around the edges of Lake\nEppalock. There are delightful\nstretches, and an unexpected\nriver crossing as we make our\nway towards Heathcote. Here we\nare joined by Sam’s Dad Tony,\nwho has arrived by bus from\nBendigo with his bike and a new\nset of panniers. Together we set\noff into the Heathcote–Graytown\nNational Park. We camp at the\nDargile campground, beside a\nfireplace and picnic table, and\nbeneath a perfect climbing tree.",
      "Much of Victoria’s Box-\nIronbark forest has been cleared,\nbut one of the last remaining\npatches lies between Heathcote\nand Rushworth. We set off to\nexplore it the next day. There are\ncountless bush tracks, including\na few that are coated in sticky\nmud. Banjo perfects a technique\nto remove the mud from his\nwheels with a stick while riding.\nDuring a break from riding,\nhe discovers a family of three\nMarbled Geckos, which seem\nsurprised to see us.",
      "Our longest and most\nchallenging day of riding\nhas a happy ending. At King\nBilly Retreat, we are warmly\nwelcomed by Lou and Les, we\nmeet the newest addition to their\nfamily, Marlowe, and big brother\nEllis arrives home soon after. We\nset up camp in their workshop\nwhich has all the luxuries we\nneed – a kettle, electric lights,\nchairs to sit on, and a roof above\nour heads. Tony is thrilled that\nfor the second consecutive night,\nno tent is required.",
      "We rise with the sun the\nfollowing morning. King Billy\nis the kind of place we could\nhappily spend many hours. The\nplace and the people are an\ninfinite source of inspiration and\nwe treasure the time we spend\nthere with the family. We share\na morning cuppa and take a\nfew photos before setting off to\nthe sounds of another Chough\nchorus. Tony has an extensive\nknowledge of the local area and\nhe guides us around the fringes\nof Rushworth and toward the\nformidable Mount Camel range.",
      "After lunch, we tackle the\nclimb through the range. On the\napproach, a vehicle passes before\nstopping in the middle of the\nroad. A woman jumps out with\nher phone. She wants to show us a\nphoto to check that she’s actually\nfound the lookout she came to\nsee, at nearby Chinaman’s Bend.\nIt looks like she has, yet she\nseems to have been expecting\nsomething more. Krista suggests\nthat the beauty in this particular\nlandscape is subtle, to which the\nwoman replies: ‘I know. I grew\nup in the country too’.",
      "We continue to the lookout,\nwhich offers an impressive view\nof the country we have traversed\nover the past few days. Banjo\nand Daisy slide on their bums\ndown a slippery slope of lush\ngrass. We complete the crossing\nof the range and roll effortlessly\ndown the other side to Toolleen,\nour home for the night. An\ninviting track leads us into a\nsmall patch of bush on the edge\nof town. There’s a picnic table\nand flat ground, which is more\nthan enough to make it a suitable\ncampsite. Sam’s Mum Robyn\narrives with afternoon tea and\ndeparts later with Tony and his\nbike.”",
      "The Heathcote-Graytown\nNational Park and the Rushworth\nforest are wonderful places to\nride a bike. It is a very special\npart of Victoria, with very varied\nflora and flora. After the good\nrains this year, it seems as though\nit will be a spectacular spring for\nwildflowers. The route taken out\nof Rushworth went to Moora,\nthen along the Moora-Heathcote\nRoad to the Tait-Hamilton Road,\nthen over the range. One person\nhad to get off his bike and walk\nto make it up to the Chinaman’s\nBend lookout, and didn’t have\nquite enough energy to take a\nshort detour to see a site of great\nhistorical significance – the\nMount Pleasant footy ground.\nNevertheless, bike riding was\nthe perfect way to explore this\nwonderful region."
