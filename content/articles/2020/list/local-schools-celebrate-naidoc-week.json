      "NAIDOC Week celebrates the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Celebrated by all Australians, it is a great opportunity to learn more about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Our local schools and Kinder mark the week in a variety of ways, all contributing to a celebration and better understanding of past and present Indigenous culture. The National NAIDOC Theme for 2020 was - Always Was, Always Will Be, recognising that First Nations people have occupied and cared for this continent for over 65,000 years.",

It was fi rst used in 1997 to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land rights, justice and reconciliation. Each hand was planted in the ground in front of Parliament House to show support for First Peoples."
