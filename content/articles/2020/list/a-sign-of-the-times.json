      "Redevelopment of the old Council Depot in Horne Street recently passed another milestone with the erection of this spectacular\nsign at the Rushworth Art Depot. Inspired by the area’s native fl ora, the sign was commissioned by Art Depot mentor Helen\nGrigg and sponsored by Rushworth and District Financial Services (our own Community Bank) as part of their on-going\ngenerous community support.",
      "The sign is a collaborative effort by\nhusband and wife team Les and Lou Pelle\nthrough their respective businesses ‘Pellecan’\nand ‘Design by Nature’ .",
      "Lou created the design,\nthen she and Les prepared\nthe many fl oral shapes from\nrecycled materials.",
      "A plasma cutter was used\nto cut the oval shape and\nletters from the metal base.\nCorrugated iron was then\napplied behind the base to\nhighlight the lettering.",
      "With its many fl owers\nfi rmly attached, the\nweighty sign was relocated\nto its new Horne Street\nhome with the generous\nadvice and assistance of\nWorkmate’s Brett Petersen\nand his heavy equipment.",
      "The Art Depot was established using seed\nfunding from the Shire of Campaspe. It is run\nby Rushworth Community House and is one\nof many activities that the House conducts at\nthe southern end of Rushworth.",
      "The Community House was recently\ngranted Committee of Management status\nover other Crown Land parcels in the area.\nDELWP, the Victorian Government’s Land\nManagement Authority, offered management\nof the expanded area to the Community House\nand the proposal was readily\naccepted. The area includes\nboth the town’s historic\nCourt House (next to the\ncurrent Police Station) and\nthe tiny old Police Lockup.",
      "The Community House\nhopes to develop the\nexpanded area for use by\ntownsfolk across a wide\nspectrum of interests.",
      "Possible uses for the Court\nHouse include theatrical\nproductions, an electronic\nmedia hub, a small fi lm\nstudio and as an uniquely\natmospheric meeting place.\nPeople with a passion for the\narts, history and meeting people are urged to\ncontact the Community House and become a\nvalued volunteer."
