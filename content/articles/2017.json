          "There is something about the Christmas season (whatever it means to you - religious festival, Santa gifts or welcome holiday time) that still manages to bring people together in a festive spirit to celebrate and be merry. This is most evident at each of our town carols nights when residents get together to ‘sing out loud and sing out strong’ all the old favourite traditional Christmas songs and to enjoy some musical entertainment and other fun activities.",
          "The Rushworth Community Carols was a great night out for all the family, with the jumping castle and face painting being a great hit for the kids.",
          "The event, originally started by Mary Beck, has been running for a number of years now. In the last five years it has grown with the involvement of local groups like the Kindergarten, St. Mary’s Primary and the Rushworth singers. This year we had all these groups involved and they did a splendid job.",
          "There was also the Rushworth and District Brass Band and Life Church band from Mooroopna who accompanied and led the crowd in singing Carols.",
          "The weather was just right for a freshly cooked sausage or hamburger with onion, (organised by Perry’s Butchery). So the food was great, the atmosphere was great and there was a sense of people enjoying themselves and being relaxed.",
          "Organisers believe there were 170 plus people at the event and plan to further improve it for 2018. The event was strongly supported by the Rushworth & District Community Bank and Christian Life Rushworth. Organisers said that without the support from volunteers and sponsors the event wouldn’t be as good as it was."

          "After two weeks of record breaking November heat, we may well have thought the tropics had moved south on the weekend, with rain, rain and more rain leading to flash flooding and closed roads.",
          "Residents were certainly well-prepared with warnings from the weather forecasters to be on standby for a deluge that would see a whole summer’s worth of rain dumped on the region over the weekend.",
          "While most roads into Rushworth were closed at various times over the weekend, Stanhope’s Johnson Road was one of the worst hit of our local roads and is still closed at the time of going to press. It was touch and go for some residents, as neighbours helped stem the flow with sandbags as the water rose.",
          "Much of the water has drained away as quickly as it arrived, but for many farmers in the district it has put a dampener on harvest time. Hopefully there will be no more follow up in the next couple of weeks and they will be able to get those headers back in the paddocks."

          "Rushworth’s new Heavy Tanker recently rolled into town and has since been put through it paces by enthusiastic members of the local Fire Brigade. The new tanker carries 4000 litres (four tonnes) of water, of which 3500 litres are available for fire fighting. By law, the remaining 500 litres are kept in reserve to protect fire-fighters in case the vehicle is trapped in a sea of flame. If a burn-over does occur, a highly-reliable quenching system is activated, dousing the huge vehicle in a protective envelope of water. Testing by the Brigade has demonstrated the power, manoeuvrability and flexibility of the new tanker, just in time for the Fire Danger Period.",
          "A number of grass and scrub fires broke out across the region in late October and early November. It was therefore no real surprise that when the regional Grassland Curing Percentage hit 80%, Fire Restrictions were quickly introduced across the Shire of Campaspe (see diagram below).",
          "Recent rains may have reduced the immediate fire danger level, but summer promises to bring with it a higher than average fire risk, requiring strict compliance with fire restrictions and great care to be taken whether having a barbeque at home or operating a large piece of agricultural equipment.",
          "The arrival of the new tanker at Rushworth is but one element in the war on fire in and around the Waranga district. The most important partners in this vital safety endeavour are you - our readers - and the care you take with fire over the coming months."

          "Mrs MacLean made particular mention of the five other past principals that were in attendance: Mr Barrie Winzar; Mr Keith Ring, Mrs Margaret Hoelter, Mr Marty Morris and Mr Kelvyn Miller. Together, the principals have lead the school for a total of 36 years.",
          "Sunday saw the school once again filled to the brim with people eager to enjoy the displays and reminisce about times gone by. About 150 people enjoyed a barbeque lunch in the glorious sunshine.",
          "The children enjoyed ice creams, games and the school’s wonderful playground, which brought beaming smiles to many faces."

Some of the more space-hungry activities formerly run at the Community House have now been transferred to the Hall, enabling both the House and the Hall to maximise the comfort and efficiency of their activities, and allowing for simultaneous use of the two adjacent facilities while sharing amenities the kitchen and other amenities at the Community House",
          "Rushworth Shire Hall has a long, proud tradition of serving the community dating back to around 1870. For many years, the building served as the hub of the Shire of Waranga, but its importance diminished considerably after the formation of the Shire of Campaspe, based at Echuca, with Rushworth one of several regional population centres that lost their local government primacy.",

Several improvements to the kitchen will be undertaken to allow the facility to comply with food safety handling requirements and “brewing” will not interfere with other activities undertaken within the Shire Hall, notably School Examinations later in the year.",
          "Meanwhile, repair work has been carried out to remove localised termite activity under the floorboards of one of the Hall offices. A Shire-appointed tradesman completed the work this week, restricting the spread of the termites and ensuring that the floor will remain structurally sound."

          "The 18-month project saw over 7,500 tonnes of concrete poured, approximately 80 containers of equipment shipped, and over 330,000 man hours worked by more than 200 contractors to build the new cheese plant, which will be able to process up to 1.3 million litres of milk every day.",

          "“The future for Australian dairy is positive. The long-term fundamentals for dairy are strong and global prices are returning to more sustainable levels. Today’s opening is a clear sign of our Co-operative’s belief in the local dairy industry and our commitment to Australian farmers.”",

          "“Fonterra cheese already tops more than half the pizzas made in China, and now we will be sending Australian-made mozzarella to cater for growing demand.",

          "This growth has been helped by demand for cheese – as disposable incomes rise, the dining-out culture is growing, particularly for pizza.",
          "In Japan, cheese consumption is rising by 3 per cent each year, with huge potential for growth. Japan is now the world’s secondlargest importer of cheese, with Australia their number one supplier.",

          "Situated at the junction of the Heathcote-Nagambie highway and the Rushworth track, the camp is now little more than tangles of rusted barbed wire which once marked the camp’s perimeter and numerous concrete slabs marking the sites of latrine blocks and kitchen facilities.",
          "I first explored the remains of this camp in 1983, at which time several wooden buildings were situated atop the hill overlooking the main road. These were all that remained of the camp’s headquarters and which were at that time still in use by the Forestry Department. The huts are now gone, leaving only the concrete footings.",
          "Graytown was of course much more than the site for a World War II POW camp. Beginning in the 1860s, this had been a rich goldfield that produced impressive quantities of gold until a major flood in 1870 inundated most of the mining activities and ruined the town’s commercial viability. This was a major stroke or irony since, in common with many of Victoria’s goldfields, mining operations in Graytown, prior to the deluge, had been severely hampered for lack of water for washing pay dirt.",
          "Nowadays high bank sluice operators who choose to operate along either Spring or Compton Creeks where there is, at the time of writing, still residual water in the numerous deep pools, will usually pick up gold that has been leached from the banks and washed downstream. For detector operators the prospects aren’t so rosy, though there are plenty of relics waiting to be unearthed.",

On the heels of his German co-belligerent, Italy’s Mussolini soon joined the war on what he obviously believed would be the winning side.",
          "As a precaution against possible internal threats by citizens of countries with which Australia was now at war, thousands of foreign nationals of German and Italian extraction were arrested by Australian police and packed off to hastily erected ‘internment camps’. It was certainly not to our credit that so many of these internees were people who had worked long and hard in a manner that would have qualified them as true pioneers and worthwhile settlers in other circumstances.",
          "To add to the problems of the Australian Government which attempted to accommodate and administer thousands of ‘internees’, Australia agreed to accept more German and Austrian internees from the United Kingdom, Egypt and Palestine. The problem was later compounded by large number of German and Italian prisoners of war arriving from North Africa where the British and Commonwealth forces were finally gaining the upper hand. POWs in their thousands were also shipped off to Kenya, Canada and the USA. Most of the cost of accommodating Axis personnel in Australia was met by the British government.",
          "<strong>Graytown</strong>",
          "The Graytown camp was listed as Prisoner of War Forestry Camp 6 and housed both German soldiers and sailors, Italians and a few Finns. The German Kriegsmarine sailors were survivors of the armed commerce raider HKS Kormoran which sank the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney in a naval battle in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday, 19 November 1941, with the loss of 645 Australian naval personnel. The sinking of the Sydney remains the most disastrous naval loss of life in a single action in Australian history and far outweighs the loss of 496 men of all three services in the ten years of the Vietnam War.",
          "The German seamen aboard the Kormoran were also brave and determined men, losing 78 crew members in the short but bloody naval artillery battle with the Sydney. The damage inflicted on the Kormoran was so extensive that the order was given to abandon ship and the vessel was scuttled.",
          "Three hundred and fifteen German seamen including their captain, Fregattenkapitan Theodor Detmars, were captured either at sea in the life craft or after their arrival on the Western Australian coast. Eventually all were sent by rail to central Victoria to be interned in the camps then being constructed. No doubt the three day journey over the Nullarbor would have created the depressing and lasting impression on these Germans that this was an inhospitable county from which escape was hardly a viable option."

I have been called to this same plover family for three consecutive years as the parents have taken to nesting on the roof of the day-care centre. When the eggs hatch, the young fall off the roof into the courtyard where they cannot get out without assistance and I relocate them next door where there is some open grassland where they were always known to nest in previous years. The last time I was called to this family was exactly two months ago and the relocation went pretty smoothly.",
          "I was surprised to receive a call last week from the day-care centre again, asking me to come and remove new babes which had again come off the roof. This time they had come off the roof into the front yard of the centre, which is the playground area for the children. As I was not able to leave immediately for Echuca, when I was ready to hit the road I gave them a call back to let them know I would be there in 45 minutes. I was informed that the plover family had moved out into the carpark area. They now just had to go through the diamond mesh fence at the side of the carpark to reach their usual feeding grounds. I called my good friend, Anita, who lives in Echuca and asked if she could go down and check on the family for piece of mind. All was well...or so I thought.",
          "Later that night I received a text from Anita saying that the chicks had fallen into the stormwater pipes through a grate and the grate could not be removed to get them out! One of the chicks was hanging through the grate as his head had somehow managed to stop him from falling to the pit below. He was limp, lifeless and cold but after being removed by Anita and warmed up, within five minutes he had come back to life. After numerous attempts to get the other two chicks she could see in the pit below, one chick disappeared down one of the pipes and the other became still and lifeless in the damp, muddy pit. The night was cold and without the warmth of their parents, small chicks cannot survive long at all. The fourth chick had not been seen at all.",
          "When we arrived we found the dead chick immediately, laying lifeless in the bottom of the pit. I decided to get it out. The parent plovers were distressed, calling and flying in and out constantly. They kept going back to the grates, knowing they had lost their babes down there. As I was using a stick which Anita had been using in her attempt to get the chicks out, thinking that because the chick had died, the stick might work now, I flipped the little body over on its back...It was stiff, neck and legs stretched out, little wings also stretched out in a fixed position. I couldn’t believe our eyes when we both saw ever so slight movement in the tiny wings! In unison we cried out, “It’s alive!” Then we sprung into gear to get the poor chick out. We knew the little bit of life that was left in this little soul was barely existent and every second mattered. Beau ran and got my snake hook out of the ute and after three attempts, I was able to carefully lift the lifeless body to the top of the grate where Beau was able to get his fingers through enough to pull him all the way out.",
          "I still wasn’t sure if he had died in the short time it took us to get him out but did not want to give up. What I did next, I have done before... sometimes it works..sometimes it doesn’t, and I know I am not the only wildlife carer who could admit to giving a critter mouth to mouth. I placed my mouth over the tiny bill and nostrils and blew quick, shallow breaths, hoping against hope for a small miracle.",
          "Still no movement, but just as I was convinced we had not got to him in time, he began to take gasping breaths! Once I was sure he was breathing steady enough, down the shirt he went to warm his freezing body. After half an hour he was moving his legs and head. After about an hour, he began to cheep. This demonstrates just how important warmth is for baby birds and baby critters in general. Warmth really is the difference between life and death for baby birds. The fall did not kill them, the cold is what almost did.",
          "The rescue of these two little chicks really was a team effort that night and I give huge thanks to Anita, who always helps me out when she can and to my son, Beau. Both are invaluable members of the Bohollow team."

          "On Sunday night I received a call-out for a kangaroo joey at Dookie. I was told it was pink and very small. The people who found it kindly agreed to meet me in Shepparton to cut down my travel time and I set off, calling Deb before I left to give her the heads up that we had an incoming joey arriving.",
          "The trip into town wasn’t a good one. As I was travelling on the road there was a car heading towards me and a car further back behind me. I caught a quick glimpse of a dark shape on the middle white lines. With the lights of the oncoming car, I couldn’t be sure what it was but I made sure I missed it and made the split second decision to turn around immediately and go back to make sure it wasn’t an animal. It only took me a minute to turn around and head back to where I saw it. In that time, both other cars had gone past and I was dismayed to find the shape had now moved to the edge of the road and was now laying on its side, kicking in agony and distress. It was a juvenile black wallaby or swamp wallaby as they are commonly known, and he wasn’t in a good way.",
          "I grabbed a towel from the ute and tried to comfort him as best I could. I could feel his nose was shattered and there was a lot of blood. All I could do was to wrap him up and take him with me, knowing that this little fellow was not going to make it and would need to be euthanised upon return to the shelter.",
          "With a heavy heart, I continued my journey and when I arrived, I discovered that the kangaroo joey happened to be a swamp wallaby joey!",
          "The people who hit this little fellow’s mother stopped immediately to check if she was still alive. Initially they thought she was still breathing until they realised, with amazement, that the movement they were seeing was this little joey moving in her pouch. They called straight away and followed my instructions to keep him warm by placing him down their jumper. He was beautiful and toasty when they passed him to me. This is so important for young joeys, particularly ones that do not possess fur, as they cannot maintain enough heat on their own to keep warm.",
          "It is also so important to stop and check if you hit a critter, any critter, bird, mammal or reptile. Even if you do not think they could have survived, they surprisingly often do and can remain injured on the road for many hours, sometimes even days or get hit again when they may have been able to be saved. In the case of our native mammals it is vital that you check if the animal is female, has a pouch and check for live young. Many pouched young survive the impact and can be saved or can also be terribly injured and require help. Pouched young can sometimes survive for days in their dead mother’s pouch. For this reason some people, particularly wildlife carers, will stop and check deceased animals for pouched young. We usually pull them well off the road and spray a cross on them with bright spray paint to let others know that the animal has already been checked to save someone else stopping to check the same animal.",
          "Through taking the time to stop and check, you may just save a life or spare one from much more pain and suffering.",
          "Deb met me back at our Bunbartha shelter where we sadly euthanised the young wallaby which I had picked up on the way, and the little pink joey was transported back to our Kotupna shelter with Deb for care.",
          "This night is a perfect example of the ups and downs of shelter life and what we, as wildlife rescuers, have to cope with on a daily basis. Life and hope in one hand, death in another.",
          "Operating a reliable 24 hour rescue service not only means we must be able to handle different wildlife species, injuries and rescue situations; it also means we must be competent at dealing with the human aspect. Just as wildlife that are injured are suffering great distress, many people who come across injured wildlife can find it very distressing and upsetting to be confronted with the situation, especially when they don’t know what they can do to help. The two kind gentlemen who hit this joey’s mother were greatly upset that she had died and when they discovered the tiny joey, they did not know who to call or what they should do. Once they made contact and realised that this little fellow could possibly be saved, they were relieved to find help and the feeling of helplessness subsided.",
          "Although we deal with horrific injury often and it is a part of our job as wildlife carers and rescuers, we too feel the same distress and helplessness at times. We are by no means immune to it, just more accustomed to it. As I placed this precious cargo into a prepared pouch for transport and chatted to the guys about what would now happen to the little joey and how his chances were good because they had stopped to check and help, it was still fresh in my mind that moments before I was on my knees in the gravel on the side of a dark road, holding a terribly wounded wallaby’s head in my hands, trying to ease his suffering, assessing his injury and making decisions on what needed to be done. I believe that when I first passed this wallaby, he was sitting, hunched over but upright in the middle of the road. I believe that one of the other two cars which were travelling from both directions actually hit him in the time it took me to turn around. While I was tending to him on the roadside, a few more cars passed.",
          "No one else stopped.",
          "If I had not have happened to be heading to a rescue, he may have spent hours suffering on the roadside before he succumbed to his injuries. Although we may not show it, we do feel the distress too, and yes, it still hurts.",
          "The little fellow in the photo (right) has an excellent chance of growing up to be independent and released back to his wild home. This is why we do what we do; for life and hope."

          "Two ibis were released at Bohollow on Friday. Both were local birds found in Shepparton and both were entanglement cases.",
          "One, a sacred ibis was the victim of fishing line and had been flying around the Shepparton Lake for a few months before I was finally able to catch him with our newest rescue tool, the net gun. Sadly, his feet had suffered badly from being caught in the line and on one foot he only had one toe left; the others had all fallen off previously through lack of circulation from the tightness of the line. The other foot had damage to the bottom of his leg and one toe was partially missing. When I finally caught him, he had deteriorated to the point of barely being able to walk and spent a lot of his time sitting right down on the ground, which is not a normal position for an ibis at all. He was also quite underweight.",
          "After spending the past month at Bohollow, he has improved dramatically. Once the line was removed, he took a few days before beginning to walk much better and the day of his release, he barely had a limp. He will always bear the scars of the fishing line but now he has the chance to continue his life without the cruel fate hanging over his head which being entangled was going to bring.",
          "This is one bird who I spent many hours attempting to catch and the happiness that fills my heart to see him hit the skies without that rotten line wrapped around his legs is one I find difficult to describe.",
          "The other bird, a straw-necked ibis, was found entangled in a soccer net at a local school. His entanglement caused severe bruising and lacerations to both his wings but after only a couple of weeks in care, all evidence of his injuries were completely gone and he was itching to get back out there. They have been buddies in the same enclosure and as they were both ready to go at the same time, they were released together.",
          "It surprised me that they both decided to stick around for a while as I know they are both flying really well. I expected them to take off into the blue yonder. We have large flocks of ibis of both species who frequent the paddocks of Bohollow and the neighbouring farmland and wetland so I know they will both join the flocks as they like to forage in groups.",
          "Interestingly, from my observations of them in their wild environment, the flocks often consist of one or the other species but nearly always, in a flock of sacred ibis there will usually be at least one straw-necked and in a flock of sacreds there will undoubtedly be a single or a couple of straw-necked. I am not sure why this is so, but I do know they mix readily.",
          "I last saw the straw-necked still feeding further out in the paddock and the sacred had flown further into the heart of the property and landed at the centre dam.",

This is a wonderful, tangible way to see what positive difference can be made for our native species.",
          "The majority of nest boxes were installed in public forests, with others installed on private land. Monitoring (data recording and photos taken inside each nest box) is conducted by Orlando Talamo, WGCMN President and local landholder.",
          "This year Orlando recorded a 60% use/occupation of the nest boxes. We have again seen plenty of evidence of a sugar gliders occupying phascogale nests and vice versa, which is probably an indication of the pressure on ‘tree hollow’ real estate. In some areas, we have seen an almost 100% use of the nest boxes, which demonstrates the ongoing need for safe habitat for these beautiful animals. The usual variety of bats, spiders, antechinus and insects are also taking advantage of this extra habitat.",
          "<strong>Monitoring statistics for nest boxes - 2017</strong>",
          "102 locations monitored (each location consisting typically of three boxes)",
          "Total boxes monitored: 306 145 active/occupied sugar glider nests (4 disused sugar gliders nests).",
          "45 nest boxes had sugar gliders present when photos were taken. 38 active/occupied brush-tailed phascogale nests 63 boxes occupied by insects 16 boxes had unidentified scats present",
          "The results are outstanding, considering these are all new boxes installed for 12 months or less. Total percentage of use/ occupancy is 60%. 12% of these are brush-tailed phascogale occupations, which is a wonderful result for nest boxes installed for one year or less."

          "An allocation of $4000 will be gratefully received by the group members enabling them to commence a community project which they hope to be completed by this spring.",
          "The proposal, which was initially estimated to cost $6000, has been unsuccessful with additional funding and has therefore been revised to suit the $4500 budget, with $500 coming from the group’s own fundraising efforts.",
          "The project aims to engage the entire community on a number of levels.",
          "Located at the Rushworth Railway Reserve, just east of the skate park, the objective of the project is to beautify an area of the Railway Reserve by providing two large wildflower beds which run quite close to the edge of the path on both sides, making it easy for walkers to view the species planted there.",
          "The garden beds are organically shaped but lineal in fashion, and run alongside the bitumen walking path, surrounding the park bench and integrating with existing plantings.",
          "At present, the area in question is made up of a number of weed species, dominated by bindii, making the area otherwise inaccessible for recreation. The design takes into account any possibilities for future use of the Railway Reserve and does not encroach on usable open space or restrict access to the goods shed. It also allows for opportunities to develop the area further as the entrance to the township from Melbourne.",
          "The wildflower bed concept was initiated by the environment group after a Goulburn Valley Water infrastructure project which saw the removal of many understory species along the Bendigo-Murchison Road. GVWater agreed to compensate by supplying the plants and tree guards, but more funding was needed to construct the beds in a professional manner.",
          "The project will see the revegetation of many of the same species which were removed, to create a wildflower display which celebrates the species diversity of the local area and can be used as an educational tool and seed bank.",
          "Garden bed construction will take up most of the funding, with materials and landscape supplies being the major expense. The rest of the work, including the actual planting activity, will be carried out by the group and any community organisation or individual who wishes to be involved.",
          "Now that the funding has been announced, a date will be set for a community planting day and local groups will be invited to take part.",
          "Members of the local environment group are very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the amenity, aesthetics and community participation opportunities for the township.",

With the popular O’Keefe Rail Trail now extended and connecting Heathcote, Axedale and Bendigo, bringing tourists to those areas, could Rushworth also be on the radar for those same trail walkers and cyclists?",
          "On Wednesday 17 May, eight members of the Friends of the Bendigo-Kilmore Rail Trail group rode into Rushworth from Heathcote. Why? Were they lost? What was to be achieved?",
          "No they were not lost, and yes they wanted to be in Rushworth! Yes, they did spend money in both Heathcote and Rushworth, and yes they enjoyed looking at places of interest along High Street, Rushworth and the former railway reserve. One cycling member and his wife plus caravan were even staying overnight at Rushworth.",
          "The real reason for the ride was to explore and assess ‘on-the-ground’, a possible cycling route between Heathcote and Rushworth, away from rural roads and traf c where possible.",
          "A route that was both interesting and safe, for the type of people who enjoy visiting rail trails.",
          "The selected route for the investigation was mostly utilising forest tracks within the Heathcote-Graytown National Park and the Whroo Nature Conservation Reserve, yet some rural roads did have to be included.",
          "With the Murchison-Rushworth (Waranga) Rail Trail having its section within the Greater Shepparton Council area completed, many trail cycling and walking tourists are waiting for the remaining section into Rushworth to be completed by the Campaspe Shire.",
          "When the trail is continuous, it will be a large boost for tourism in the area, plus being used by the local community. Maximising this trail’s potential would bene t hugely from also being connected to other such trails, like the O’Keefe Rail Trail.",
          "A funded feasibility study is currently investigating the potential and possibility of a proposed Wallan to Heathcote Rail Trail (65kms). Such a trail would directly connect to the O’Keefe Rail Trail (50kms) at Heathcote, a combined 115kms trail. The study’s consultants are also investigating the possibility of linking such a trail into the Melbourne Metro trail network, as well as the Great Victorian Rail Trail. This possibility has huge potential for Victorian regional cycle and walking tourism, the creation of a network of linked trails. The study’s  nal report is expected to be published by July of this year.",
          "In the meantime, Friends of the Bendigo-Kilmore Rail Trail members who rode the 50kms on Wednesday were impressed by their chosen route, as well as the points of interest noted along the ride.",

          "Earl was found on the ground at a farmland property at Earlston. There was no mother koala in sight, but in a nearby tree an adult male was spotted.",
          "Although it is outside the main breeding time for koalas in our area they can also mate during this time, so there is always the possibility that little Earl was separated from his mother in an altercation between her and a male. Like many of our patients here at Bohollow, we will never know his full story as to how he ran into trouble and ended up alone on the ground, but he has likely been without his mother for more than just one day as he is under-weight.",
          "Deb picked him up from our Bunbartha shelter shortly after I arrived home with him and he has already perked up considerably with regular feeds and care. He will be raised by Deb at our Kotupna shelter and eventually go on to be released if all goes well.",
          "Female koalas usually begin to breed around three or four years of age and can have one offspring each year, although sometimes they may only produce young once every two or three years. This can depend on food sources, habitat and the age of the female. Females average a lifespan in the wild of around twelve years and during their life they may only have  ve or six young.",
          "From conception to the birth of a koala joey, it only takes 35 days! Newborn koalas are teeny, only weighing in at about a gram and measuring around 2cm long. Just like other marsupial joeys, they are akin to a hairless, pink, blind jelly bean and they make the same arduous journey from the birth canal to their mother’s pouch without any help. To do this, they rely on their sense of smell and touch, using their already strong forelimbs and claws to make the climb. Upon reaching the safety of the pouch, the koala joey attaches itself to one of two teats. The teat swells to  ll its tiny mouth which helps to prevent the babe from detaching and mother koala contracts muscles at the top of her pouch to keep her young safe and free from the danger of falling out.",
          "For six to seven months, the koala joey remains in the pouch, only drinks its mother’s milk and develops eyes, ears and fur. When they are around twenty-two weeks old, they begin to take peeks out of the pouch with freshly opened eyes.",
          "Koala mothers also produce a substance other than milk which is called pap. Pap has a soft, runny consistency and is actually made of faeces (droppings) and this is a vital part of the joey’s diet from around twenty-two to thirty weeks. Pap contains the micro- organisms in the mother’s digestive system and is rich in protein which, through digesting the pap, is passed onto the joey. This allows the transition from milk to eucalyptus leaves, as these important micro-organisms enable the koala to digest them. To feed on pap, the joey must lean out of the pouch. Pap becomes a regular part of their diet until they begin to feed on fresh leaves, usually feeding on these while on their mother’s back. When a koala joey is too big to  t inside the pouch, the mother’s teat becomes very elongated so it protrudes from the pouch to make feeding easier. A baby koala will continue to drink milk from their mother until they are a year old and remain with their mother until the next joey appears from the pouch. Therefore if a female does not have another joey the following year, her joey will often remain with her longer and has a greater chance of survival.",

          "Rushworth Court House is re-awakening. Waranga News of 30 March reported on plans to remove bats and white ants, and to appoint local management. Now the imposing old building, built in 1877, is featured in a new book by local historian and News writer Alan McLean, titled “Order in the Court!”",
          "The book shows the Court House has witnessed an extraordinary passing parade, some arriving on foot, others tying a horse to a nearby rail or tree. The building welcomed “an able-bodied specimen of the loa ng fraternity”. Another defendant challenged the nasal senses, being “as shy of water as he was of work”. More than one went up for endangering lives by “furious riding”.",
          "In 1887, after 18 years as a Justice of the Peace, Wolton Wigg, a local brewer, was called into the dock, not to his preferred seat on the Bench. Found in a boat with a gun and a bag of dead game birds, he strangely pleaded “not guilty”! The good J.P. was convicted and  ned for shooting ducks out of season. His career on the Bench continued but his days hearing poaching charges were over.",
          "In 1898, a well-known Rushworth woman was accused of “pilfering and behaving in a way not conducive to the morality of the township”. She went to Bendigo gaol, found guilty of being a “disorderly prostitute”. If only she had been a little more orderly...",
          "Some left the Court House escorted across a paddock to “compulsory retirement in the logs” for a short period. Others won a longer visit to “Her Majesty’s boarding house”, referring to Queen Victoria.",
          "A predecessor timber Court House was hastily built in 1857. Not attending to face charges was a once well-respected local bank manager, Lowson Salmon. He and the bank’s cash left the district coincidentally one night in 1860, never to be seen again.",
          "Even before that original building was constructed and within six months of the discovery of gold in 1853, two visitors to the local diggings went straight to Melbourne’s Supreme Court where they were convicted of separate crimes at Moora and Rushworth. Both were hanged in Melbourne Gaol.",
          "In 1857, three men went down for “highway robbery” near Rushworth’s Criterion Hotel. The Moora hotels, the Wanalta hotel and several hotels at Whroo also had their share of unwanted action. In a major shock, the book  nds that some pubs traded outside legal hours!",
          "More than one publican was  ned for operating an unlicensed billiard table. Others were found guilty of allowing unauthorised dancing in their “public houses”. Law and order in the district were plainly under serious attack from the forces of evil!",
          "Brawling Chinamen,  ghting farmers, horse thieves, aggressive foul-mouthed drunks, passive drunks, cadgers, owners of sly-grog shanties, swagmen carrying more than their own goods (usually in a bottle), owners of destructive wandering goats and pigs, carriers who neglected to put their name on their cart, a man found at night in Wigg’s brewery, and a mother of 14 who failed to send her eldest child to school for the speci ed number of days. All passed through the Court House door, each earning a place in the book.",
          "Lucky to avoid a visit in 1883 were Murchison loafers and vagrants who had “thoroughly mastered the art of living on nix, and getting drunk on the pro ts!”",
          "These colourful characters, and many more, bring to life the  rst  fty years of settlement at Rushworth, Colbinabbin, Corop, Gobarup, Moora, Stanhope, Toolleen, Wanalta, Whroo, and Murchison.",

It was a Sunday when we visited – and they were all there – the whole 1.25 billion – well, not really, but it felt like that for those of us used to space and a lot less people!",
          "From Agra, we visited Jaipur (the pink city), Pushkar (a holy city nestled on a lake on the edge of a desert) and Jodphur (the blue city). While we were in Jodphur we were lucky enough to attend three concerts that were part of the Sacred Spirit Festival. What an amazing experience. The evening concerts were held in the Mehrangarh Fort. The Fort was lit up against the night sky and the music was so very beautiful it is impossible to do justice by way of explanation. After this we travelled to Varanasi. This city is considered very holy and many pilgrims come to Varanasi to bathe in the Ganges River. It is considered auspicious to die and be cremated in Varanasi. This extremely busy and fascinating city is undergoing many changes at present, which will hopefully make life easier for the residents. This is only a brief snapshot of all the things we saw and experienced.",
          "Throughout our tour, we had regular yoga classes which were designed to either prepare us for the day ahead or relax us and calm us for a good night’s sleep. We also attended a Laughter Yoga class in a park in Jaipur which was a lot of fun. Ridiculous really – but a lot of fun!! We also attended a community sunrise yoga class down by the Ganges while in Varanasi. The food and accommodation was excellent throughout. Our Indian guide, Amit, went out of his way to ensure we were informed, comfortable and enjoying ourselves. And, being a yogi himself, he even had us doing yoga on the bus some days. We walked, we talked, we ate, we laughed, we saw amazing sights and we all came home with a great appreciation for India.",
          "In many ways, the highlight of the trip was the fantastic group of people. Everyone had a great time and we all enjoyed one another’s company."

          "A much loved and highly respected resident of Rushworth, Doris Barlow was farewelled at St Paul’s Anglican Church and at a graveside ceremony at the Rushworth Lawn Cemetery, both of which were conducted by Fr. André Du Plooy, on the afternoon of Friday 3 March.",
          "The esteem in which Doris was held was evident by the large number in attendance, with St Paul’s Church packed.",
          "Among the family present were Doris’s sisters, Enid and Marion, and the family of her other sister, Jean, who was not well enough to attend. Also there were Doris’s daughter, Heather, and sons Ross, Colin and Neil, together with members of her extended family.",
          "The tribute to Doris was presented by her son, Colin, on behalf of the family and forms the basis of the following information.",
          "<strong>The early years</strong>",
          "Doris was born in Natimuk on 23 October 1925 to James Palmer and his wife Ida (nee Pfennig). Three sisters followed: Jean, Enid and Marion. Her mother, known as Edie, died of pneumonia in Woodend at age 35, two months after Marion’s birth.",
          "Doris attended Kyneton High School, and then went to Melbourne Teachers College, whilst living with her family who had transferred to Essendon.",
          "<strong>The teacher</strong>",
          "Doris first taught at an upper elementary school in the northern suburbs of Melbourne for a year, Yarram Upper Elementary for a year, then transferred to Rushworth.",
          "<strong>Family life</strong>",
          "It was at Rushworth that Doris met and married Robert Henry (Bob) Barlow, a third generation farmer. The wedding was in Essendon, and then Doris took on the duties of housewife, retiring from teaching after the initial eighteen months at Rushworth.",
          "They lived on the family farm ‘Moorakyne’, speaking often of the candle and kerosene lighting days and irregular water supply, depending on the temperamental windmill on the Nine Mile Creek.",
          "Bob and Doris had four children: Heather, Ross, Colin and Neil. She was thrilled by the arrival of Heather’s children (Narelle and David), Ross’s children (Alexandra and Andrew) and Colin’s children (Christopher, Matthew and Catherine), and loved knitting baby clothes as each new baby arrived. There are now six great grandchildren.",
          "The friendship and support of neighbours were very much appreciated and Bob and Doris had a lot of fun playing tennis at Wanalta, and golf at Rushworth and further a field.",
          "<strong>The move into Rushworth</strong>",
          "The difculty of providing water and the absence of power on the farm led to Bob and Doris building a new solid brick house called ‘Wyeera’ in Moora Road, about the time Ross was born. This was the family home and continued to be Doris’s residence until frailty forced her into the Waranga Aged Care Hostel and then the Nursing Home.",
          "Both Bob and Doris continued playing tennis and golf after shifting into Rushworth, until well into their sixties, and in the later years took up bowls as well. Many longstanding friendships that continued for the rest of their lives were initiated on the sporting  elds. Doris loved playing golf, not only at Rushworth, but also at Tatura and other surrounding clubs.",
          "<strong>Love of travel</strong>",
          "Doris travelled extensively in Australia, including the Canning Stock Route, Rabbit Flat, Ayers Rock and all the capital cities.",
          "She also regularly ventured overseas to Europe, Asia, New Zealand and many other places.",
          "<strong>Community involvement</strong>",
          "Doris was involved in many community organisations over the years, including: The Council of Adult Education; Probus; The ‘buddy program’ at the school; Secretary of the Rushworth CAG (the Shire of Campaspe Advisory Group after the amalgamation of the shires); Neighbourhood Watch; Rushworth Senior Citizens; School and sporting club committees; The Waranga News.",
          "<strong>Thank you</strong>",
          "Colin concluded his address by saying, “On behalf of the family, I would like to sincerely thank the staff at the Waranga Aged Care Hostel and more recently the Nursing Home for the wonderful way they cared for Mum, and I must also thank Judy Ogden, Laurel Goggin, Nan Jessup and the many others who regularly visited and supported her whilst in care. Mum never failed to mention every time I visited her how lucky she was to be so well cared for at the Nursing Home.”",
          "<strong>A life well lived</strong>",
          "Doris’s life was certainly well lived. As Colin said in the eulogy, the family thought her life was best described in the words of the Frank Sinatra song, ‘I Did It My Way’."

We have grown over the years to such an extent that last Easter (2016) we had ninety-three ‘big horses’ all working throughout the day and 2000 to 3000 people through the gate. May I have a small boast by saying we are only W.A and the N.T. short of having horses coming from Australia wide to moora!",
          "In 2010 we decided to move our event to Easter Sunday to complement the Rushworth Easter Heritage Festival held on Easter Saturday. By making it a two separate days weekend we hoped it would help bring extra people and tourists into the town and district and therefore be helping the local economic situation.",
          "The 2013 Shire survey showed the two days bought close to half a million dollars into the town and district, something both committees are extremely proud of as we had all achieved our goal!",

Some will be on the road for several hours to get here, but then, some from NSW, SA and our Queenslander can expect to be on the road not just hours but days! I just hope that our Tasmanian has a better trip over than last Easter, as he and his two beautiful big horses and the dog were twelve hours on the boat coming across in that dreadful storm the week before Easter. He wasn’t allowed down to the truck to check if the boys were safe and standing up or if they were down and cast. A terrifying trip over for them all.",
          "When Raymond and I went out to the Moora Reserve early on the Friday morning to see if they had arrived and alright, we were met by four very exhausted travellers! Luckily horses and their slaves, plus dog, are very tough characters! After several feeds and sleeps they were all back on track again! Some of you may remember seeing them last year, the big coach with the two huge grey shire horses in the shafts both in the street parade on Saturday and working round at Moora on Sunday.",
          "Our line-up this year will include all your old favourites that will be ploughing, harrowing, scarifying, and pulling sleds etc. There will also be a variety of different horse-drawn vehicles on parade for you to see and photograph. Plus, a line-up of different working displays. I’m excited because our own stationary baler has been set in order and working again. It was owned and used by the late Max Seamer who was the driving force behind our Working Draught Horse Muster and our founding member.",
          "Salty’s hammering up a storm and old Dave will be giving him his usual cheek! Big Mick the rope-maker will be there with bells on, or so he tells me! Bill the packsaddle man is loaded up and hot to trot as is Wiltshire’s Harness store and the rest of our “Mug’s Alley” traders, not forgetting the camp oven scone man. Yum!",
          "Michelle Bird, equine artist, after a lifetime spent with her beloved horses has turned to now drawing them. She captures their expressions beautifully! We are rapt to be able to have once again one of her framed works as  rst prize in our raf e. Last year’s picture was Rick’s big team and I am looking forward to seeing who will star in this year’s prize.",
          "The craft demonstrators are gathering all their wares again. Lyn’s Ironbark Soy Melts and Rushlyn Studio’s hand-made cards, together with the folk-art ladies, are all brushed up and glued to their chairs, as are the Lace Making ladies with their  ne and fancy goods. Jenni’s Shed with her most beautiful leather goods just has me enraptured and Michelle will be displaying her beautiful pencil drawings; you can watch her creating a new work of art. All these wonderful people are more than happy to show and explain how they work.",
          "The resident music makers are all getting warmed up to belt out all the old and new classics for you, so grab a cuppa and cake or lunch and sit, listen, and enjoy them! There are plenty of tables and chairs! The jumping castle man is back again too! Plus, heaps more!",
          "Just give me a call if you want more information, or you can join in the fun by giving us a hand for an hour or so! Either way here’s my number/email 58561405 st-thoms2@ optusnet.com.au. Take care folks and see you all soon!",

It is also reasonable to consider that this action could be a catalyst for recognising and promoting the ecotourism potential of Rushworth’s natural environment.",

The group learned that the proposal to continue the trail is well under way, with the Shire of Campaspe currently in negotiations with DELWP and Regional Development Victoria to complete the trail to Rushworth and extend it through the forest. This would give rail-trail enthusiasts (and there are plenty) the ability to travel by train from Melbourne to Murchison and cycle the central Victorian gold elds, spending time and tourist dollars in small towns like Rushworth.",

Many opportunities were highlighted within the culturally and naturally diverse landscape to enhance existing tracks with up- to-date signage and locally accessible maps. There is also potential to complement tours of the forest with the latest technological applications for the more cyber-savvy users who want an informative exploration of Rushworth’s local forest without carrying a paper map!",

Its location, right in the centre of Rushworth, means that residents are not cut-off from the town facilities and can always get a yarn if they are up to a walk down the street.",

          "Campaspe Mayor, Cr Adrian Weston, said the volunteering opportunities on offer included a broad range of hands-on roles at the shelter as well as foster carers to look after the animals for short periods of time in their own home.",
          "“The Campaspe Animal Shelter provides a safe, temporary place for lost, stray or unwanted dogs and cats until a permanent home can be found, so we are looking for volunteers passionate about providing the highest quality of care for these animals during their stay at the facility,” Cr Weston said.",
          "“This is a wonderful opportunity for the animal lovers in our community to make a positive and valuable contribution to the ongoing physical and psychological wellbeing of these animals.",
          "“All animals at the shelter are tested for temperament and health, so volunteers and foster carers would only care for those that have passed all the tests and have been deemed suitable for adoption.",
          "“As the focus of this council service is to re-home the animals, the quality of care provided by volunteers is vitally important in ensuring each animal has the best possible chance of  nding its forever home.”",
          "To ensure the suitability of volunteers for particular roles, council has a comprehensive volunteer recruitment program in place that includes an expression of interest process, then upon acceptance, formal induction, training and on-site health and safety education.",
          "“This system not only assists us to match volunteers with jobs aligned with their knowledge, skills and experience, it enables prospective volunteers to fully understand what’s involved in becoming a volunteer,” Cr Weston said.",
          "Positions on offer for the current intake of volunteers include general assistants to help with play, exercise and grooming with the Campaspe Animal Shelter. Foster carers are also needed to provide short-term respite within their own home for animals who may have been at the facility for extended periods of time.",
          "Council is holding a public information session on Thursday, 9 March from 6-7pm at the Echuca Civic Centre Function Room for interested members of the public to  nd out more about these volunteering opportunities. Further information, including application forms, is also available on Council’s website <a href=http://www.campaspe.vic.gov.au>www.campaspe.vic.gov.au</a>.",
          "Expressions of interest must be received by Council by Monday, 20 March. These can be emailed to shire@campaspe.vic.gov.au or sent to Campaspe Shire Council, PO Box 35, Echuca VIC 3564.",

The school children were all dressed in period costume, appropriately setting the scene for celebrating 100 years of education in Colbinabbin.",
          "School leader, Jack McArdle, welcomed all the guests and then added a special welcome to Department of Education colleagues, past principals, past and present school council presidents and councillors, past and present Parent and Friend members, past and present staff members and pupils.",
          "Barrie Winzar, Principal from 1965-1967, addressed the crowd gathered and reminisced fondly about his time at Colbinabbin, with some funny anecdotes, and noted how the physical buildings had changed so much. However he believed that the crowd present was indicative of the fact that the Colbinabbin community spirit had not changed and that this community was indeed still the special place he remembered.",
          "Following this, House Leader, Ned Morgan, and Prep student, Herb Ireland unveiled the centenary plaque.",
          "The next stage of the proceedings saw the burying of a time capsule that had been made by the children. House Leader, Kiara Kaiser, read out a list of all the items that had been placed in the time capsule. Josh Simeon, Green Team Leader, then placed the capsule in the ground and read the plaque to the audience gathered. The ceremony concluded with the children singing a rendition of Waltzing Matilda.",
          "Principal, Robyn MacLean, thanked all those who had worked to prepare the school for the special celebrations. Wendy Morgan, who has taught at the school for many years, then cut the cake depicting a ‘100’ as the crowd gave three cheers for the future of the Colbinabbin Primary School. Those gathered then enjoyed a delicious morning tea prepared by the Colbinabbin parents and coordinated by Centenary Celebrations working group member, Robyn Ryan.",

          "A recent public outcry about the state government’s <a href=http://www.wnews.org.au/articles/list/carnage-in-state-forest.html>track-blocking policy</a> has urged a number of state MP’s and local government representatives, to visit the now famous ‘Telstra Trail’.",
          "Social media attention for the ‘Telstra Track’ near Rushworth has brought the standard practice of track- blocking into scrutiny as thousands of comments are recorded from across the nation complaining that public land is becoming increasingly inaccessible.",
          "Last week staff from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, admitted they were responsible for the widely condemned action of felling track-adjacent trees along seven kilometres of the popular ‘Telstra Trail’ in the Redcastle-Graytown State Forest, near Rushworth. They say this was done to deter trail- bike access and allow the track to regenerate after increased off-road use. Spokesperson, Paul Bates, is quoted saying around one hundred trees were felled across the track; however, a survey conducted by a local resident has recorded one hundred and ninety-three live trees have been destroyed. Over one hundred dead trees and branches have also been dragged across the forest  oor to create obstacles. It was noted that a large machine was used to move and push many of the trees over and that this machinery caused signi cant and widespread damage to countless native understory  ora species.",
          "The vox pop on social media shows that the community is unhappy not only about the environmental damage and access restriction, but also because there was no public consultation. Residents claim that prior to the Department’s actions the track was in good condition with minimal damage. It is described as a good, all-purpose track for walking and cycling on. The department spokesperson stated that walkers and cyclists may continue to use the track but it is evident that the new obstructions present great dif culty and danger to current legal users and that trail-bike riders will now just ride around the felled trees and cause further damage to the environment. A trail-bike rider on social media claimed that the obstacles will just make the track more of a challenge. It is interesting to note that not until after the works were complete, were signs erected advising users of restricted access. The attempt to prevent illegal use of the area has also encouraged the illegal collection of  rewood, with people already removing the fallen trees.",
          "The clear message that has been voiced to the environment minister by a number of state MPs in parliament is that forests should be able to be appropriately used by the public, but environmental concerns, including forest conservation and protection of ecosystems, must also be addressed.",
          "The department has acknowledged that in hindsight it should have done things differently, but unfortunately there is no way to turn back time. Instead the minister must look into the situation and create safeguards to protect the environment from future similar actions as well as to allow the public fair access and ongoing use."
