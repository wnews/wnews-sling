      "There were happy faces throughout Rushworth last week as the town’s first petrol station in many years opened for business. Bright and early on the Monday morning, the pumps were activated, the fuel price indicator board lit up, and the station’s three franchisees stood ready to welcome its fi rst customer through the door.",
      "Three of the happiest faces belong to the Melbournebased team from Metro Fuels whose efforts have transformed the old High Street petrol station into a clean, modern asset that will benefi t the whole town and its residents.",
      "Minutes after the station formally began delivering fuel at opening-week prices, Metro Fuel’s Rushworth franchisees Kim Kunda, Lucky Thind and Nadeer Hormiz (photo at right) were all smiles. Over the following week, traffic was steady, boding well for the future of the station.",
      "For the record, the station’s first paying customer was local tradesman John Meguyer, who had undertaken much of the concreting at the station site."
