      "Following demolition, the site will be offered to other Victorian Government Departments for alternate use and may be sold should no further use be identified.\n",
      "GV Health is ensuring that trees on the site are being protected during the demolition, and that some bricks from the old hospital building will be salvaged to create a memorial wall at Waranga Health in High Street, Rushworth."
