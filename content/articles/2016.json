          "Rushworth Garden Festival, spread over two weekends this year, was once again a great success. The Garden Expo on the second weekend was a vibrant collection of plant stalls, handmade craft, garden produce, live music and guest speakers. The community joyfully embraced the new concept and an atmosphere of sharing and promise for the future resonated throughout the village green. Organisers are to be applauded for their initiative and the above image of the P-12 kitchen garden produce emulates this fresh approach."

          "The celebrations commenced on Friday with the local school children, their parents and friends, launching one hundred balloons to celebrate the one hundred years life of the school (pictured above).",
          "Many visiting former students and staff inspected the school during the afternoon, along with all its modern facilities.",
          "Saturday was the main day of celebrations, with more than 300 people attending the school to inspect the facilities, together with a photo display of students from years gone by, but most importantly, to catch up with former friends and mates from their school days, some more recent, but most from many years ago. There were many memories revived and stories told of years gone by (mostly true, but some perhaps a little exaggerated).",
          "The afternoon concluded with photos being taken of groups of former students, representing the ten decades of the school.",
          "Following such a successful day, the dinner in the Stanhope Community Hall was just as successful, with more than one hundred attending. Once again stories from the past were related by some of the very senior students, including Mr David Bell, the oldest living former student, now in his mid nineties. The members of the organising committee were rightly ecstatic with the highly successful weekend."

She was head-hunted to work with the St Vincent de Paul Society as Social Justice coordinator for the NorthEast Central region which often takes her off to Shepparton or Melbourne for meetings (just when we need her here), and her work in St Mary’s Parish includes playing music and being a member of the Parish Pastoral Council.",

Now known as the Waranga Trail, the signing of land management agreements has been endorsed by Campaspe Shire Council so that external funding negotiations can go ahead.",
          "Campaspe Mayor, Cr Leigh Wilson, said Council’s endorsement of the project would facilitate negotiations with grant bodies and partner organisations to secure funding to deliver the project some time in the future.",
          "“The Waranga Trail has been a subject of consideration by the local community and Council for over ten years,” Cr Wilson said.",
          "Over the past six months, Council has undertaken feasibility studies and cost/benefit analyses to assess the viability of the trail project. This information can now form the basis of a business case which will position the project as an attractive funding proposition.",
          "The proposed Waranga Trail includes the rail trail from Murchison to Rushworth and a connecting trail through to Heathcote. Scoping and estimates for the section of the trail, from Rushworth eastwards to the shire boundary towards Murchison and the section from Heathcote to Rushworth, have now been completed.",
          "Discussions and negotiations have been held with VicTrack, Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Goulburn Murray Water, Parks Victoria, City of Greater Bendigo and private land holders. Consultation has also included Regional Development Victoria to affirm the potential viability of securing funding support.",
          "“Based on these consultations, we have concluded that construction of both reaches of the trail is feasible and will generate a positive return on investment,” the Mayor said.",
          "An interim costing predicts the Rushworth to Murchison link will cost approximately $1.2 million and the Heathcote to Rushworth link will cost approximately $1.1 million.",
          "The Waranga Trail is identified as a key Shire of Campaspe project in the Regional Development Australia prospectus. Council officers have undertaken more detailed work seeking to secure access rights to the trail route to eliminate risks and issues should the project be funded.",
          "“Council’s endorsement of the project and signing of agreements with VicTrack and Goulburn Murray Water to secure tenure of land will demonstrate our full commitment to potential external funding bodies,” Cr Wilson said.",
          "However it’s not all in the bag yet. External grant opportunities are likely to require Council to match any funding contribution dollar for dollar. Council says it is committed to negotiating with stakeholders and partners to a point where the project is ready to go should the funding become available.",
          "While the project does not extend to a trail linking Girgarre to Rushworth at present, Council acknowledges this would have the capacity to generate positive health and wellbeing outcomes for local residents.",
