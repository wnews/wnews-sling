          "As vintage 2020 comes to a close,\nwinemakers and grape growers around\nthe country are taking stock of what was\na particularly challenging vintage. But the\nnews is not all bad for local wine lovers.",
          "With COVID-19 occupying the news over\nthe last couple of months, it’s easy to forget the\nevents that shaped our summer. The Australian\nwine industry was particularly exposed to the\nchallenges posed by dry conditions, bushfires\nand finally the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "The growing season started with dry\nconditions, due to a lower than average\nrainfall over winter. None the less, the vines\nbegan their march toward harvest with bud\nburst occurring in early spring.",
          "In late November, hot windy weather\ncoincided with flowering in some grape\ngrowing regions of south-eastern Australia.\nThe hot conditions resulted in a reduction\nin the number of flowers that set fruit on the\nvine, reducing the yield potential of some\nvarieties. The weather was very warm in\nDecember, however it moderated in January,\nallowing vines to grow well and establish a\nhealthy canopy.",
          "Meanwhile, the bushfires in New South\nWales, South Australia and Victoria grew\nin size and burnt larges areas of each state.\nThe fires sadly destroyed some vineyards,\nwhile many others were indirectly affected\nby smoke taint. Smoke taint occurs when\nripening grapes are bathed in fresh smoke for\na period of time. Compounds from the smoke\nare absorbed into the skin of the grape, which\ncan be transferred to the wine during the\nwinemaking process.",
          "<strong>Not affected by smoke\ntaint</strong>",
          "Thankfully, testing of grapes prior to\nharvest at the Australian Wine Research\nInstitute laboratory showed that grapes from\nthe Heathcote wine region were not affected\nby smoke taint.",
          "“We feel grateful because some growers\nin the Hunter Valley and other regions\nadjacent to the fires chose not to harvest at all\nthis year,” said Gerard Kennedy of Kennedy\nVintners.",
          "Finally, in the middle of vintage, Australia\nwent into lockdown due to the COVID-19\npandemic. This dealt the industry another\nblow because of its reliance on the hospitality\nindustry and cellar doors to sell the majority\nof our wine.",
          "While it has been a challenging vintage\nfor Heathcote producers, this year’s wines\nare developing to be of excellent quality,\nwith intense colour and flavour. This is a\nvery positive and welcome end to an eventful\nvintage 2020.",
          "If you are looking to purchase wine,\nplease consider supporting one of the many\nsmall businesses located in the Heathcote\nwine region. Many wineries have online\nstores and will ship directly to your door.",

When open, it will dispense Western Fuels.",

A new one shell 60,000 litres fibre-glass tank with four compartments was installed on Thursday 20 June 2019, and the remaining concrete, a lot of soil and old infrastructure have been removed since work re-began, and piping from the storage tank to the fuel outlets has been installed.",
          "Asked why the work on the station, which was scheduled to be completed towards the end of August last year was delayed, Simon Stanley said a contributing factor was getting the necessary permits from the authorities.",
          "When asked about rumours circulating about the delay, he said:",
          "<ul><li>There had been no unexpected problems with the sale of the business.</li><li>There has been no change in ownership or the business supplying fuel.</li><li>There are no doubts about the service station being profitable.</li></ul>",

          "Rushworth & District Community Bank has announced a grant of $10,000 for the Waranga News to support a technology upgrade and ensure our local paper can continue to be produced to its very high standard and quality.",
          "The Waranga News is a local institution operating for over 40 years, communicating important local news and events and connecting our communities by sharing great things that happen around us.",
          "The Rushworth & District Community Bank grant of $10,000 has provided new computers and software to ensure our local paper continues to be published by hard working volunteers.",
          "“ The vastly increased costs of upgrading technology in recent years has threatened the viability of our local community newspaper, so we are extremely grateful for this grant which will enable us to continue our important work of communication within and between the towns in our district,” said editor Mary Jo Fortuna. “We thank the Rushworth and District Community Bank for this further contribution to the functioning and wellbeing of our local communities,” she added.",
          "The Bendigo Community Bank model is based on a ‘profitwith- purpose’ philosophy, which means profits are returned directly to the local community that has generated them. Importantly, the community decides where those profits are invested. The fact branches are locally owned and operated with funding returned to that particular community is a distinct point of difference to other banking institutions.",
          "More than $1 million has been returned to Rushworth & District communities and initiatives over the past 18 years just from people choosing to do their everyday banking with the Rushworth & District Community Bank. Our community bank is locally owned by our shareholders and its our community that benefits from banking with our local community bank.",
          "“We have been proud to support the Waranga News since we brought banking back to Rushworth and this grant will ensure that we keep connections within our communities, shares our great local achievements and have access to important local issues,” stated Chairman Christine Borger.",
          "“Today’s announcement further demonstrates the deep connection we have with our Rushworth community. It is a great reminder of the good that banking locally can do when profits are returned to benefit local people and their communities. This grant is just another important investment we’ve made locally since 2002 and is on top of the more than $130,000 returned to Rushworth and the surrounding communities last financial year,” she concluded."
