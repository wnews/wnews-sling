          "Redevelopment of the old Council Depot in Horne Street recently passed another milestone with the erection of this spectacular\nsign at the Rushworth Art Depot. Inspired by the area’s native fl ora, the sign was commissioned by Art Depot mentor Helen\nGrigg and sponsored by Rushworth and District Financial Services (our own Community Bank) as part of their on-going\ngenerous community support.",
          "The sign is a collaborative effort by\nhusband and wife team Les and Lou Pelle\nthrough their respective businesses ‘Pellecan’\nand ‘Design by Nature’ .",
          "Lou created the design,\nthen she and Les prepared\nthe many fl oral shapes from\nrecycled materials.",
          "A plasma cutter was used\nto cut the oval shape and\nletters from the metal base.\nCorrugated iron was then\napplied behind the base to\nhighlight the lettering.",
          "With its many fl owers\nfi rmly attached, the\nweighty sign was relocated\nto its new Horne Street\nhome with the generous\nadvice and assistance of\nWorkmate’s Brett Petersen\nand his heavy equipment.",
          "The Art Depot was established using seed\nfunding from the Shire of Campaspe. It is run\nby Rushworth Community House and is one\nof many activities that the House conducts at\nthe southern end of Rushworth.",
          "The Community House was recently\ngranted Committee of Management status\nover other Crown Land parcels in the area.\nDELWP, the Victorian Government’s Land\nManagement Authority, offered management\nof the expanded area to the Community House\nand the proposal was readily\naccepted. The area includes\nboth the town’s historic\nCourt House (next to the\ncurrent Police Station) and\nthe tiny old Police Lockup.",
          "The Community House\nhopes to develop the\nexpanded area for use by\ntownsfolk across a wide\nspectrum of interests.",
          "Possible uses for the Court\nHouse include theatrical\nproductions, an electronic\nmedia hub, a small fi lm\nstudio and as an uniquely\natmospheric meeting place.\nPeople with a passion for the\narts, history and meeting people are urged to\ncontact the Community House and become a\nvalued volunteer."

          "Made possible due to the unprecedented\nvolume of donations to WIRES from within\nAustralia and around the world following the\nBlack Summer bushfires, this grants program\nwill support wide-ranging regeneration\nprojects focused on restoring habitat impacted\nby the bushfires.",
          "Projects include rainforest revegetation,\ninstallation of nest boxes to replace destroyed\ntree hollows for decimated native species,\nfeeding programs for endangered wildlife,\nmanagement of invasive weeds, erosion\ncontrol and protection of our waterways and\naquatic habitat.",
          "WIRES CEO Leanne Taylor said\n“Regeneration of impacted habitat is key to\nsupporting our vulnerable native wildlife.”\n“This program is an excellent example\nof how we can use donations to support\ngrassroot community organisations to make a\nreal difference and deliver positive outcomes\nfor our wildlife now and in the future.”",
          "Landcare Australia CEO Dr Shane\nNorrish applauded the overwhelming\nresponse to the grants program, citing the\nextraordinary commitment landholders and\ncommunity environmental groups display\ntowards the relief and recovery of bushfire\nand drought-impacted regions across the\ncountry, particularly when Australia is facing\none of its most challenging times in recent\nhistory.",
          "Dr Norrish said: “While the nation has\nbeen impacted by the worst global health\npandemic in living memory, effectively halting\non-ground bushfire and drought regeneration\nactivity, the desire and motivation to get on\nwith the recovery effort has been astounding,\nand the demand for assistance and the quality\nof applications so great, WIRES provided\nadditional funding to support more groups\nthan originally contemplated.”",
          "Dr Norrish added: “Landcare and\nenvironmental community groups need\nfinancial support to help with habitat\nrestoration, regeneration and building\nresilience of bushland while providing\nprotection for threatened species and other\nnative animals which ultimately, enhances\nconservation outcomes and connects\ncommunities.”"

Rail trails are a great way\nto bring people into small towns,\nwhere they can help to stimulate\nthe local economy.",
          "During their two-week tour,\nthe family stayed mainly at free\ncamping sites. (It would be\nfantastic if Rushworth had such\na site - a guaranteed way to get\npeople to stop over in this area.)",
          "The family comprised Sam\nand Krista, and their two kids,\nBanjo (10) and Daisy (7). They\nare experienced bike tourists,\nhaving ridden through Chile\nand Argentina in 2019. On this\noccasion, their bikes included\na tandem (Sam and Daisy) and\ntwo standard bikes (Krista and\nBanjo). An average day was\nabout 40 kilometres, mainly\ntravelling on back roads. They\ncarried all their food, water and\ncamping gear in panniers on\ntheir bikes. Their starting and\nfinishing point was their home\njust out of Woodend.",
          "Here is part of their blog,\nstarting at Mia Mia and\ncovering parts of the local\nWaranga area.",
          "“The next day is full of entirely\nnew roads. In the morning, they\nwind back and forth through\nfarms around the edges of Lake\nEppalock. There are delightful\nstretches, and an unexpected\nriver crossing as we make our\nway towards Heathcote. Here we\nare joined by Sam’s Dad Tony,\nwho has arrived by bus from\nBendigo with his bike and a new\nset of panniers. Together we set\noff into the Heathcote–Graytown\nNational Park. We camp at the\nDargile campground, beside a\nfireplace and picnic table, and\nbeneath a perfect climbing tree.",
          "Much of Victoria’s Box-\nIronbark forest has been cleared,\nbut one of the last remaining\npatches lies between Heathcote\nand Rushworth. We set off to\nexplore it the next day. There are\ncountless bush tracks, including\na few that are coated in sticky\nmud. Banjo perfects a technique\nto remove the mud from his\nwheels with a stick while riding.\nDuring a break from riding,\nhe discovers a family of three\nMarbled Geckos, which seem\nsurprised to see us.",
          "Our longest and most\nchallenging day of riding\nhas a happy ending. At King\nBilly Retreat, we are warmly\nwelcomed by Lou and Les, we\nmeet the newest addition to their\nfamily, Marlowe, and big brother\nEllis arrives home soon after. We\nset up camp in their workshop\nwhich has all the luxuries we\nneed – a kettle, electric lights,\nchairs to sit on, and a roof above\nour heads. Tony is thrilled that\nfor the second consecutive night,\nno tent is required.",
          "We rise with the sun the\nfollowing morning. King Billy\nis the kind of place we could\nhappily spend many hours. The\nplace and the people are an\ninfinite source of inspiration and\nwe treasure the time we spend\nthere with the family. We share\na morning cuppa and take a\nfew photos before setting off to\nthe sounds of another Chough\nchorus. Tony has an extensive\nknowledge of the local area and\nhe guides us around the fringes\nof Rushworth and toward the\nformidable Mount Camel range.",
          "After lunch, we tackle the\nclimb through the range. On the\napproach, a vehicle passes before\nstopping in the middle of the\nroad. A woman jumps out with\nher phone. She wants to show us a\nphoto to check that she’s actually\nfound the lookout she came to\nsee, at nearby Chinaman’s Bend.\nIt looks like she has, yet she\nseems to have been expecting\nsomething more. Krista suggests\nthat the beauty in this particular\nlandscape is subtle, to which the\nwoman replies: ‘I know. I grew\nup in the country too’.",
          "We continue to the lookout,\nwhich offers an impressive view\nof the country we have traversed\nover the past few days. Banjo\nand Daisy slide on their bums\ndown a slippery slope of lush\ngrass. We complete the crossing\nof the range and roll effortlessly\ndown the other side to Toolleen,\nour home for the night. An\ninviting track leads us into a\nsmall patch of bush on the edge\nof town. There’s a picnic table\nand flat ground, which is more\nthan enough to make it a suitable\ncampsite. Sam’s Mum Robyn\narrives with afternoon tea and\ndeparts later with Tony and his\nbike.”",
          "The Heathcote-Graytown\nNational Park and the Rushworth\nforest are wonderful places to\nride a bike. It is a very special\npart of Victoria, with very varied\nflora and flora. After the good\nrains this year, it seems as though\nit will be a spectacular spring for\nwildflowers. The route taken out\nof Rushworth went to Moora,\nthen along the Moora-Heathcote\nRoad to the Tait-Hamilton Road,\nthen over the range. One person\nhad to get off his bike and walk\nto make it up to the Chinaman’s\nBend lookout, and didn’t have\nquite enough energy to take a\nshort detour to see a site of great\nhistorical significance – the\nMount Pleasant footy ground.\nNevertheless, bike riding was\nthe perfect way to explore this\nwonderful region."

          "As vintage 2020 comes to a close,\nwinemakers and grape growers around\nthe country are taking stock of what was\na particularly challenging vintage. But the\nnews is not all bad for local wine lovers.",
          "With COVID-19 occupying the news over\nthe last couple of months, it’s easy to forget the\nevents that shaped our summer. The Australian\nwine industry was particularly exposed to the\nchallenges posed by dry conditions, bushfires\nand finally the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "The growing season started with dry\nconditions, due to a lower than average\nrainfall over winter. None the less, the vines\nbegan their march toward harvest with bud\nburst occurring in early spring.",
          "In late November, hot windy weather\ncoincided with flowering in some grape\ngrowing regions of south-eastern Australia.\nThe hot conditions resulted in a reduction\nin the number of flowers that set fruit on the\nvine, reducing the yield potential of some\nvarieties. The weather was very warm in\nDecember, however it moderated in January,\nallowing vines to grow well and establish a\nhealthy canopy.",
          "Meanwhile, the bushfires in New South\nWales, South Australia and Victoria grew\nin size and burnt larges areas of each state.\nThe fires sadly destroyed some vineyards,\nwhile many others were indirectly affected\nby smoke taint. Smoke taint occurs when\nripening grapes are bathed in fresh smoke for\na period of time. Compounds from the smoke\nare absorbed into the skin of the grape, which\ncan be transferred to the wine during the\nwinemaking process.",
          "<strong>Not affected by smoke\ntaint</strong>",
          "Thankfully, testing of grapes prior to\nharvest at the Australian Wine Research\nInstitute laboratory showed that grapes from\nthe Heathcote wine region were not affected\nby smoke taint.",
          "“We feel grateful because some growers\nin the Hunter Valley and other regions\nadjacent to the fires chose not to harvest at all\nthis year,” said Gerard Kennedy of Kennedy\nVintners.",
          "Finally, in the middle of vintage, Australia\nwent into lockdown due to the COVID-19\npandemic. This dealt the industry another\nblow because of its reliance on the hospitality\nindustry and cellar doors to sell the majority\nof our wine.",
          "While it has been a challenging vintage\nfor Heathcote producers, this year’s wines\nare developing to be of excellent quality,\nwith intense colour and flavour. This is a\nvery positive and welcome end to an eventful\nvintage 2020.",
          "If you are looking to purchase wine,\nplease consider supporting one of the many\nsmall businesses located in the Heathcote\nwine region. Many wineries have online\nstores and will ship directly to your door.",

          "As reported in the last Waranga News, there is excitement in Rushworth that there is ‘some long awaited action at the High Street service station site’.",
          "Simon Stanley, the National Installation Manager for Fuel System Solutions, the business undertaking the work for the owners, Aksara, says the work at the service station is expected to be completed by the end of March, with the opening date up to the owners to decide. When open, it will dispense Western Fuels.",
          "There has been no change to the plans. While the front facade of the building will remain unchanged, there will be new electrical wiring and the building’s interior will be fitted out as a ‘normal’ service station shop. A new one shell 60,000 litres fibre-glass tank with four compartments was installed on Thursday 20 June 2019, and the remaining concrete, a lot of soil and old infrastructure have been removed since work re-began, and piping from the storage tank to the fuel outlets has been installed.",
          "Asked why the work on the station, which was scheduled to be completed towards the end of August last year was delayed, Simon Stanley said a contributing factor was getting the necessary permits from the authorities.",
          "When asked about rumours circulating about the delay, he said:",
          "<ul><li>There had been no unexpected problems with the sale of the business.</li><li>There has been no change in ownership or the business supplying fuel.</li><li>There are no doubts about the service station being profitable.</li></ul>",
          "Asked if the financial viability of the owner was a possible reason for delay, Simon Stanley said his business (Fuel Solutions) never comments on any business’s finances.",
          "The opening of the service station, the only one in Rushworth, will be a wonderful asset. Locals will no longer need to leave town for fuel and will be more likely to buy products and services from Rushworth businesses, rather than shopping elsewhere while getting fuel out-of-town."

          "The project involves installation of both ground mounted and roof mounted panels at a select number of GVW facilities across the Goulburn Valley over the coming months.",
          "General Manager of Planning and Assets, Daniel Hughes, said this work is part of a large-scale project to install over 4,800 high-efficiency solar PV panels on GVW land and infrastructure, resulting in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 4,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year.",
          "‘This project is intended to reduce both greenhouse gas emissions, and operating costs associated with energy bills,’ he said.",
          "The panels installed at Rushworth will produce an average annual energy production of over 40,000 kWh, the equivalent amount of energy required to run the plant.",
          "‘It is our intention to neutralise energy consumption at each of the selected sites,’ he said.",
          "‘The number of panels installed at each of the sites has been determined based on the amount of energy that plant requires to run, and we expect that eventually the operation of these sites will be optimised so they predominantly function in sunlight hours.’",
          "This roll out project is at about the halfway mark and is being delivered by Solgen Energy Group.",
          "This comes at no extra cost to customers."
