          "While we might not have greatly progressed our insight into the future, one thing we do know is that the answers should come from you - our readers. The Waranga News is a ‘community owned’ paper and so everyone has the chance to contribute, to have a say and, hopefully, to come up with good ideas on how we can best keep the show on the road with happy, informed and entertained readers!",
          "This is just one reason why we are inviting you to our Open House on 18 November, so that you can see how the Waranga News is put together, see a ‘rogues gallery’ of faces of volunteers over the forty years, peruse displays and old copies of the paper and see how it has changed over time. For many of you it will offer a dose of nostalgia as you recall events of the past. There will also be the chance to meet up with some old friends who have volunteered in the past but moved away. For more recent arrivals it offers a chance to learn more about your new home.",
          "The other reason we are inviting everyone? Well everyone likes an excuse to party!",

          "Highlights of the day were the amazing line-up of local musicians who performed at ‘Lisadurne’ garden throughout the day, and Rushworth’s Artistries holding a ‘plein air’ painting day with artists being challenged by the weather in the morning but rewarded for their perserverence in the afternoon with sunny skies.",
          "An exhibition of their completed works will open in the Motofinish Cafe at 6 pm this Friday 26 October and everyone is welcome. There is a $5 entry fee with refreshments served and the exhibition will continue until Sunday 4 November. Full details can be found on Page 11.",
          "Keen gardeners and interested onlookers came out from all around the region despite the wild start to the day to enjoy walking around the gardens, purchasing plants and garden ornaments, viewing mosaics and sculptures and also sampling some fine fare and coffee at ‘Lisadurne’.",
          "Participating gardens in Rushworth belong to Glenys Miles in Murchison Road, Rod and Vicki Young in Parker Street and Carol and Norm McMillan in Pound Road. ‘Lisadurne’ on Heily Road and ‘Bonshaw’ at Stanhope completed the circuit.",

          "Following a circuit which included the once-busy streets and roads of Whroo, the walkers, armed with maps, photo-sheets of local blooms and history snapshots to study at numbered points, completed the walk in the bright sunshine.",
          "With local orchids and native blooms in low numbers, and even the wattle well down on recent years, the interest turned to the Balaclava mine, the sites of old water wells, the puddling machines, the cyanide vats, the cemetery, and the Aboriginal water-hole.",
          "Organiser Nick Buzza said, “It was pleasing to get 130 registrations, and the positive responses from locals, former locals and visitors to the district.”",
          "Nick was appreciative of support roles played by Eloise, Steve Arnold, Liz and Greg Buzza, Heather Wellington and Whroo residents Damian and Helen Grigg, who enabled walkers to enjoy a cup of tea or coffee.",
          "Whroo began as the Wet Diggings in 1853, and was very briefly home to close to 10,000 people who rushed to the gold-find, while others tried the Dry Diggings at what became Rushworth. With so little water available and gold only gathered by the fortunate, the unsuccessful soon rushed off to fossick elsewhere, while some joined with others to sink deep shafts in search of the elusive metal.",
          "Owners of hotels dug wells and created underground tanks lined with bricks and, in some cases, local stones. Several were visited as part of the walk. As a Rochester visitor said, “If these wells were built in the 1850s, you have to admire those skills, over 160 years later.”",
          "It will take early spring rain to entice a few more wildflowers this year, but they will be back in 2019."

Up until three years ago each community within the shire received a per capita allocation and a $75,000 allocation was made to the pool reserve. All of the above mentioned communities have been involved in the Community Planning process in the last twelve years. All have money left in their Community Planning Reserves.",
          "The CPIF pool reserve was established three years ago to replace allocations to individual communities. The residual funds were available to all communities once their individual allocation was expended. Council’s change in direction away from the community planning program requires the pool of funds to be disbursed to allow its finalisation. The Community Planning Officer has worked with local communities to determine their priorities for the funding.",

          "As a result of these allocations each of these communities will have expended their Community Plan Implementation Funds Reserves in the next twelve months with the pool reserve going towards the Waranga Trail."
