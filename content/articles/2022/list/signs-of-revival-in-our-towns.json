In Rushworth a community BBQ to welcome new residents to town attracted close to 100 enthusiastic new and old residents who spent the day meeting, chatting and enjoying lunch provided by the sausage sizzling experts,  the Rushworth SES.  Many finished off the afternoon at the opening of Eloise Mitchell’s ‘Wildwood’ exhibition at the Rushworth ART Depot, another  successful event (especially evidenced by the number of red dots on paintings within the first hour!)",
