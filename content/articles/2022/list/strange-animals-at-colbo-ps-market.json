  "abstract": "There were quite a few unusual animals spotted at the Colbinabbin Primary School Market this year.  At first sight some of them may have looked a bit intimidating, but on closer examination it was clear they were generally quite friendly,  like this sociable goanna (pictured  left) . Even the scary tiger (above) turned out to be none other than young Lucy Price behind those tiger whiskers!  The annual Market Day was as always a great success, and kept up the tradition of being one of the highlights of the Colbinabbin year. ",
