    "content": "<p><strong><em>RAD Exposed</em> opened at Rushworth ART Depot recently with an air of enthusiasm, bringing a group of local artists together to exhibit their artworks. It involved a weaving together of many different aspects of art and crafts as conversations covered new workshops, ceramics spaces, as well as the art works themselves. The exhibition runs until Sunday 27 March.</strong></p><p><strong>The next exhibition will be a solo show by Eloise Mitchell called “Wildwood Days’ which will open on Sunday 3 April. One of Eloise’s works (<em>pictured above)</em>, <em>Pangolin’s Cave 1</em> which features in RAD Exposed sold last week at the ART Depot.</strong></p><p><strong>Daniel Miller and Monique Offord <em>(pictured right)</em>, who are new to Rushworth were among those present on the night. Daniel purchased Heather Wellington’s painting <em>Outback Tree 1</em> which reminded him vividly of their recent trip to central Australia.</strong></p><p><strong>Up coming RAD workshops will include a resin workshop by Moko Designs (Monique and Daniel).</strong></p><p><strong>Gallery hours Thursday 9.30 - 2pm and Sunday 11 - 2pm</strong></p><p><br></p>"
