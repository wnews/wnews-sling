Whilst this may be great for the family pets that appreciate the increased attention, it has put a strain on many households.\n\nSome studious bean-counters have even suggested that this new working relationship can significantly reduce costs to the organization, as when everyone works from home there is less of a demand for real estate and other expenses related to hosting a workforce.\n"
