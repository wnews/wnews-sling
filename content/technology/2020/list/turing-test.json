      "In 1950, Alan Turing, a prominent Computer Scientist, devised a test to evaluate the ability of a machine to mimic human behaviour.",
      "The test would consist of a human evaluator communicating with two other participants via text-based means. One of the two participants would be human, whilst the other is a machine.",
      "The test is concluded when the evaluator is able to confidently identify the machine participant. If the evaluator is unable to reliably identify the machine participant the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test."
