    "Bake in moderate oven for 10 minutes.\n",
    "Topping\n",
    "Combine all ingredients in a bowl, mix well. ",
    "Spread the HOT base with jam, then the topping. ",
    "Bake in moderate oven thirty minutes.\n",
    "For a different taste, I substituted half jam and half rhubarb. Delicious! Rhubarb haters didn’t even know!\n",
    "I have also tried using only rhubarb, nice but too moist. ",
    "Also, never substitute shredded coconut for dessicated (which I’d done in the latest batch). It makes it too hard to cut neatly.\n",
    "The moral of this recipe: “It’s a goodie. Don’t mess with it.”\nBon appetit!"
