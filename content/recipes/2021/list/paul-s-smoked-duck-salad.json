  "abstract": "It’s not really MY turn to do a Cooks’ Column, but one of the Cooks Team has gone missing in action . . . well, no, she’s really just escaping for some round-Victoria tripping while the beautiful autumn lasts.\nHimself and I have renewed a friendship with a couple from over Shepparton way through a love of ‘going fishing’. Well, that is: the men love to go fishing, and the women love eating any fish caught. I guess that’s pretty universal, but this fellow has fishing down to a fine, adjusted, educated skill and is willing to share the knowledge with Himself.\n(All of which reminds me of a story about a local who was telling me he’d had no luck - been fishing all day. ‘Where did you go?’ I asked. ‘Down the footy ground,’ was his reply. . . I don’t need to tell you that the only water in sight at the footy ground is the swimming pool!)\nAnyway, back to our REAL fisherman: he’s also a shooter who treats his hunting the same way as his fishing, taking only what’s permitted, returning undersized fish to the water etc. But he presented us with two home-smoked duck breasts and the recipe how to use them in a salad.

  "sidebar": "We loved the salad so much that I tried another version the next night (which is the one in the photo). No more duck breasts. We ate this salad with a barbecued lamb chop! But the combination of the grilled walnuts and pear is just so divine. I added home-grown tomatoes and some ricotta cheese. "
