  "abstract": "We really are trying hard to remember to check the zucchini patch each day . . . but some still seem to escape our notice till they’re over-size.\nI’ve come up with another way to use them (apart from soups, slices, cakes, muffins, pickles, stuffing them etc).\n",

    "Large zucchini",

  "method": [
    "I cut a large zucchini into 4-5cm wide circles and cut out the centres using a large scone cutter and discard this part (edible but a bit seedy, so into the compost they go). ",
    "I then drizzled my sandwich press with some olive oil and cooked the zucchini slices for a few minutes one side, before flipping over (a bit more olive oil added, S&P)  and breaking an egg into the centre of each slice, and cooking till the egg white was firm - we like our yolks runny!",
    "I topped them with some crispy bacon pieces and some finely chopped spring onions to serve.",
    "A dob of sour cream might have added a touch of luxury."
