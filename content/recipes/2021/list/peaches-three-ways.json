      "#1 Stewed Peaches: use your own method regards the amount of water and sugar you use. I’ve tweaked it a bit by gently simmering the fruit until just softened, then removing the fruit and adding 1/2 cup caster sugar, a couple of thin slices fresh ginger and a slurp of verjuice.  Bring the liquid back to the boil, then pour over the fruit and let cool. The ginger and verjuice is very subtle.",

      "Pop into a bowl big enough, add juice,  a generous slurp of olive oil and season to taste. This goes perfectly with chicken, salmon and pork. Pretty much use whatever excess bounty you have on hand or been gifted.",
      "Wow - that’s it. Gotta love summer fruits.Share it around, substitute other fruit, enjoy.\nCheers Pauline"
