      "I’ve been keeping myself busy doing lots of cooking lately, and especially since buying myself a ‘new’ second-hand toy. A Thermomix or TM5.  A ‘Thermie’ has been something on my wish list for a number of years, and spotting an amazing bargain on Facebook Marketplace, I took the plunge and haven’t looked back. I LOVE IT! \nNow though this is a Thermomix recipe, I believe it would be very easily adaptable to conventional oven and stovetop cooking."
