  "ingredients": [
    "850g cauliflower, trimmed, cut into florets\n(don’t be too fussy cutting it up)",
    "1 ¼ cups self-raising flour",
    "1 garlic clove",
    "¼ cup flat leaf parsley",
    "1 cup grated parmesan cheese",
    "2 eggs, lightly beaten",
    "olive oil, for shallow frying",
    "2 sliced spring onions",
    "some paprika, pepper and salt for extra\nflavours (next time I’ll add some chilli!)",
    "Added 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese.",
    "fruit chutney, to serve (I instead used\nnatural Greek yoghurt with finely sliced\nspring onions)"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Preheat oven to 150 degrees Celsius. Bring\na saucepan of salted water to the boil over\nhigh heat. Add cauliflower. Return to the boil\nand cook, uncovered, for 4-6 minutes or until\ntender. Drain. Transfer to a board and roughly\nchop (I just drained with colander and mashed\nit in the saucepan). Set aside to cool.",
    "Sift the flour over cooled cauli. Add\ngarlic, parsley and parmesan (plus any other\nadditions you’ve decided on). Stir to combine.\nPour over egg and stir until well combined.\nSlowly add ¼ cup of water, stirring until a\nthick batter forms.\nN.B. I found I needed to add dribbles of\nwater to the batter throughout the process as\nit tended to thicken while sitting.",
    "Add enough oil to a large, non-stick frying\npan to cover base. Heat over medium heat\nuntil oil is hot. Using ¼ cup of mixture per\nfritter, spoon fritters into hot oil. Cook for\n4-5 minutes each side or until golden and\ncooked through. Transfer to a wire rack.\nPlace in oven to keep warm while cooking\nremaining fritters",
    "Fritters can be served hot or cold\n… Enjoy! Claire"
