  "ingredients": [
    "200g chopped butter",
    "300g good dark chocolate",
    "1/4 cup cocoa",
    "1/4 cup water",
    "1tsp vanilla",
    "1 cup caster sugar",
    "3 eggs lightly beaten",
    "3/4 cup SR flour"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Preheat oven to 160ºC. Grease and line a\n20cm round tin x 6cm deep (*). Put butter, 200g\nchocolate and 1/4 cup water into microwave\non medium for 1 minute at a time, stirring\nwith metal spoon until melted.",
    "Add sifted cocoa, stir until smooth. Stir in\nvanilla, sugar and egg. Sift flour and gently\ncombine.",
    "Pour half mixture into baking tin. Sprinkle\n50g chopped chocolate on top. Cover with\nremaining mixture. Sprinkle remaining\nchopped chocolate on top.",
    "Bake for 55-60 minutes. Skewer should\ncome out with moist crumbs. Cool in tin.",
    "Serve with fresh cream and strawberries\n(if you don’t think you have enough calories\nin the cake itself!).",
    "It stores in the fridge for a good week.",
    "* As is usual when I make a cake, I baked\nmy mixture in a slice tin. This way it doesn’t\nhave to rise and look like a cake should.\nBesides it sort of ends up looking like a\n‘Brownie’ and is easier to cut and serve either\nas just something to nibble on with a cuppa\nor served as a dessert with fresh cream and\nberries.",
