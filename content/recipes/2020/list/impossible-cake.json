  "ingredients": [
    "4 eggs",
    "1/2 cup melted butter",
    "1/2 cup plain flour",
    "1 cup coconut",
    "2 cups milk",
    "2 tspn vanilla essence",
    "3/4 cup sugar",
    "Juice and zest of a lemon/orange."
  ],
  "method": [
    "Just beat it all up together and pour into a\ngreased dish over some stewed fruit and bake\nit till it’s golden on top. And lo and behold:\nyou have a very quick and easy hot dessert.\nServe with cream, ice-cream or custard - or\njust as is.",
    "Confession Time: I forgot to add any\norange or lemon juice and zest . . but it was\nstill delicious. I cooked it over some lightly\nMW fresh peach slices. And dusted it with\nicing sugar to make it look ‘more interesting’\n- didn’t make much difference, to be honest.",
    "In the interests of no one else but myself,\nI thought I’d Google ‘Impossible Pie’ - and\nwould you believe it? It’s the exact same\nrecipe but not cooked over fruit. You do get\na sort of firmness or ‘crust’ forming on the\nbottom and a nice crunch-layer on top with a\ncustardy-type middle.",
    "I recall that we (friends of many years\nago around Colbo who shared cups of tea and\nconversations including ‘What Cheeses Me\nOff’ sessions) used to cook it in a round pie\nplate, so it did look more like a custard tart.",
    "It makes me think of how many of my\nrecipes are titled with somebody’s name:\n‘Judith’s Chocolate Peanut Biscuits’, ‘Anne’s\nBaked Cheese Cake’, ‘Hazel Balls’ (which\nwere really Rum Balls without the rum), and\nTHIS recipe called ‘Brenda’s Impossible Pie’",
    ". . . I even had a recipe for ‘Pat’s So Easy\nChocolate Cake that even Aunty Glad Can\nMake It’. I admit to being the Aunty Glad\nmentioned in the title. I am no cake cook. Glen"
