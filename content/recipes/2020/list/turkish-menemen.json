      "Multiculturalism in Australia contributes\nso much to our way of life in so many ways,\nbut probably the stand-out for many of us\nis . . . interesting and delicious food! And\nbecause we have so much diversity n offer,\nwe can also take and adapt and even mix\nthe dishes up a bit – a true cultural melting\npot!",
      "This is my take on Turkish Menemen - an\neasy one-pan breakfast dish (or lunch if\nyou like)."

  },
  "ingredients": [
    "2 Tbsp olive oil",
    "1 onion sliced",
    "2 cloves garlic",
    "1 red or green capsicum sliced",
    "1 red chilli deseeded & chopped or chilli\nflakes to taste (optional)",
    "1 zucchini sliced",
    "1 eggplant sliced",
    "400 g can chopped tomatoes",
    "2-4 eggs (depending on how many people)",
    "Parsley roughly chopped for garnish",
    "Natural yoghurt for serving"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying\npan. Saute onions, garlic, capsicum, zucchini\nand eggplant* (a little chilli if that’s your\nfancy). Cook until they begin to soften. Add\nthe tomatoes, mixing well. Cook until the\nliquid has reduced, season.",
    "Using a wooden spoon, create\npockets in the tomato mixture and crack the\neggs into them. Cover the pan and cook the\neggs over a low heat until just set. (If you\nwish you can break the eggs up a bit so that it\nflows into the vegetable mixture.)",
    "Season to taste and sprinkle the with\nparsley. Serve straight from the pan with a\ndollop of natural yoghurt.",
    "If you’re not partial to eggplant you\ncan leave it out with little effect on the dish.\nIn fact the real Menemen is made with just\npeppers and tomatoes as the base.",
    "In the interests of further cultural\ndiversity, or if you would rather get your\nprotein from somewhere other than eggs,\nmy latest discovery is some diced haloumi\n(especially the chilli infused one) is also\ndelicious. ......MJ"
