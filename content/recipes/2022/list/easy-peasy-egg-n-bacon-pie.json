  "abstract": "Sometimes you are just looking for something quick and easy for lunch or dinner, something where you can just throw all the ingredients in a bowl, mix it around and pop it in the oven.\nThis Easy Peasy Egg and Bacon Pie recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law. It reminds me of making Zucchini Slice only you don’t have to spend ages grating zucchini, and before you read the recipe and think , ‘I have to grate the cheese’, I buy it already grated and keep it in the freezer. \nIt doesn’t really look like a ‘pie’ as such. To me a pie requires pastry, but this very versatile ‘pie’ can also be baked in a slice tin, should you wish to take it on a picnic or are asked to ‘bring a plate’. ",
