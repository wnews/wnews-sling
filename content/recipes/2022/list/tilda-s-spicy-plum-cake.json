  "abstract": "It’s handy when one’s grandchildren grow old enough to cook when they come to stay.\nOur granddaughter Tilda arrived to have sleep-overs, bringing with her a bag of plums from their very own tree in Bendigo, and then proceeded to bake us a Spicy Plum Cake. \nI don’t own a spring-form cake tin, but my old dented 9 inch  cake tin did the trick.",

  "ingredients": [
    "1½ cups plain flour\n\n",
    "1½ tspn baking powder\n",
    "1 tspn cinnamon\n",
    "¼ tspn nutmeg\n",
    "½ tspn salt\n",
    "½ cup soft butter\n",
    "1 cup sugar\n",
    "1 large egg\n",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
    "½ cup milk\n",
    "½ kg plums, pitted and quartered\n",
    "2 tbspn sugar extra"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Preheat oven to 180ºC. \n",
    "Grease a 9 inch cake tin or spring-form cake tin well with butter. ",
    "We decided it might be a good idea to line the bottom of the tin with baking paper to make it easier to cut and remove the cooked cake.\n",
    "Sift dry ingredients a couple of times. ",
    "Beat butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, add the egg and vanilla and mix well. ",
    "Gradually add dry ingredients alternating with milk and beat until smooth. ",
    "The batter is quite thick.\n",
    "Arrange the plums on top, skin side up so that they cover the batter, then sprinkle with the extra 2 tbspn sugar.\n",
    "Bake for 60-70 minutes until golden on top and set in the centre. ",
    "Run a knife around the edge of the tin (and remove the springform edge and let the cake cool on a rack still on its base).\n",
    "Tilda served it up to us with ice-cream AND cream - which is, I admit, going a bit too far. But it was delicious."
