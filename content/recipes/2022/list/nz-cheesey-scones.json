  "abstract": "We love to go to New Zealand to visit our very dear friends and when we are out and about exploring in the quaint little towns that are in the area and stop for a coffee, the cheese scones, found in every café and coffee shop are a definite favourite. \nWe just love them and they are now also popular with our kids, once I found a recipe that remotely tasted like the ones we love so much over there!\nI make them for lunch and we might eat them plain with butter or add a slice of ham or tomato. \nI call them NZ Cheesy Scones",
