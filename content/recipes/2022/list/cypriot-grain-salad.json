    "½ cup coriander shredded",
    "¼ cup parsley shredded",
    "½ red onion, finely diced",
    "1 cup coarse burghal",
    "½ cup puy lentils",
    "2 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted",
    "2 tbsp slivered almonds, toasted",

  "method": [
    "Soak burghal in a large bowl of water for twenty minutes, then strain and push out all excess water – you can wrap it in a clean tea towel to do this. ",
    "Whilst the burghal is soaking, rinse puy lentils (search through for any little bits of debris like stones which are very common in almost every pack).  ",
    "Boil for twenty minutes and drain.  ",
    "Mix all ingredients together and then coat it in the dressing and serve.  ",
    "My daughter assures me that it tastes just as nice the following day. ",
    " But, if it’s so delicious, how come there’ll be any left the next day?",
    "Happy Christmas everyone - especially to those who won’t be eating my salad, but will be very happy chomping down on a barbecued snag or something similarly simple."
