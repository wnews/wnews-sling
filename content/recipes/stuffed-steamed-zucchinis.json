    "2 medium sized zucchinis\n",
    "2 Perry’s thin beef or pork sausages\n",
    "2 spring onions finely chopped\n",
    "1 large cup mashed potato (I actually used Deb!)\n",
    "2 lup cheong chopped (Chinese sausage)\n",
    "about 6 chopped water chestnuts.\n",
    "Salt and pepper to taste (remembering that the sausage meat and lup cheong are already salted)"
  ],
  "method": [
    "I sliced the zucchinis lengthwise and scooped out the soft seedy middle. \n",
    "(If you have big zucchinis, you can just slice them along the length into rounds, and  hollow out the seeds leaving a ‘bottom’ to hold the filling).\n",
    "Next I squeezed the meat out of the snags into a bowl, added all other ingredients and mixed it well together.\n",
    "Then it was simply a matter of pushing it gently into the hollowed out zucchini. ",
    "I steamed them for about 15 minutes. ",
    "I hadn’t added any extra salt or pepper and they were fine enough for me. ",
    "You could serve with a sprinkle of soya or oyster sauce, if you like."
