        "Rushworth Garden Festival, spread over two weekends this year, was once again a great success. The Garden Expo on the second weekend was a vibrant collection of plant stalls, handmade craft, garden produce, live music and guest speakers. The community joyfully embraced the new concept and an atmosphere of sharing and promise for the future resonated throughout the village green. Organisers are to be applauded for their initiative and the above image of the P-12 kitchen garden produce emulates this fresh approach."

There were many memories revived and stories told of years gone by (mostly true, but some perhaps a little exaggerated).",
        "The afternoon concluded with photos being taken of groups of former students, representing the ten decades of the school.",
        "Following such a successful day, the dinner in the Stanhope Community Hall was just as successful, with more than one hundred attending. Once again stories from the past were related by some of the very senior students, including Mr David Bell, the oldest living former student, now in his mid nineties. The members of the organising committee were rightly ecstatic with the highly successful weekend."

Scoping and estimates for the section of the trail, from Rushworth eastwards to the shire boundary towards Murchison and the section from Heathcote to Rushworth, have now been completed.",

Consultation has also included Regional Development Victoria to affirm the potential viability of securing funding support.",

        "Rushworth’s 2015 Anzac Day Dawn Service began with powerful words from local RSL President, Bill Barlow. “Welcome to you all on this most signi cant occasion, arguably the most important anniversary and the most important centenary in our nation’s history.",
        "“(Anzac Day) is our day when we as a nation remember all those who have fought and died for their country in time of con ict, but especially this morning. “We remember and honour not only those original Anzacs who landed at Gallipoli 100 years ago today, but all Australians and our brother New Zealanders who fought and died for the cause of freedom in that most horrendous and tragic period in our nation’s history”.",
        "As more than three hundred people gathered around Rushworth’s High Street War Memorial, the ritual was played out with great solemnity and respect.",
        "Those assembled heard the poignant words of a letter written to local loved ones on 24 April by Charlie Bale, a man who was to die the very next day. The Ode about not growing old was followed by the Last Post, a minute’s silence and the Reveille, the familiar sequence that is at once haunting and uplifting."
